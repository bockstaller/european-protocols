 Mr President, I am always amused when I hear that someone has not remembered to sign in. Now the same thing has happened to me. When I came in yesterday there was an enormous queue of people waiting to sign in. I thought I would leave it until later, but I forgot to do so. I did, however, participate in the meeting of the Liberal group which began at 4.00 p.m., and the evening sitting. I hope this will be entered in the Minutes.</p>

Even by its own timetable, it knows that it does not need an opinion from us until the March plenary. It is fully aware that all ten rapporteurs for the Committee on Foreign Affairs, Security and Defence Policy are halfway through the task of commenting on these partnership agreements.</p>
<p class="contents">There are important issues here of parliamentary involvement and supervision of the enlargement process, but that is a debate for next month. It is not a debate for this month. I hope that all colleagues, including those in the Group of the Party of European Socialists, will feel that this is a request for urgency that we should treat with the contempt that it deserves and throw out and reexamine this issue next month.</p>
<p class="contents">I wish to say, in all friendship to my colleagues in the Labour Group, that I understand the attractions of affection for a Labour Government. But it does not do the credibility of this House any good if it looks as if the Socialist Group is being used as a whollyowned subsidiary of the British Presidency. We should throw this urgency out and return to this matter next month.</p>

<img align="absmiddle" alt="" src="/doceo/data/img/arrow_summary.gif"/>  <span class="doc_subtitle_level1_bis">Titley </span> <span class="bold">(PSE).</span> – Mr President, the accession partnerships are the foundation stones of the very inclusive enlargement strategy which this Parliament overwhelmingly voted in favour of as a political priority. The Luxembourg Summit concluded that all the elements have to be in place by 15 March for enlargement to proceed. If we do not grant urgency today we will not therefore give our opinion until 11 March, the day before the European Conference. In those circumstances, and right up against a timetable deadline, it is inconceivable that Parliament's voice will even be heard, never mind listened to. If we give our opinion this month our message could be got across very clearly to the Council in plenty of time for it to consider it.</p>
<p class="contents">We also risk being seen as hampering enlargement. We have concerns which the Council and the Commission have sought to address, but we should be careful that we are not seen to be playing cute institutional games, which nobody outside this Chamber can understand, at the very moment when our commitment to the political priority of enlargement should be clear and unambiguous. By not granting urgency, this Parliament has nothing to gain and everything politically to lose. I therefore urge that we support urgency.</p>

<p class="contents">I ought to postpone the vote for seven minutes. The purpose of that is to protect Members so that they may know when they will be voting. But since I see that the House is full, as people have come here earlier, I wonder whether I could ask Parliament's permission to speed up the vote, and I will of course ask our services, next time, to be more careful about these matters.</p>

 Mr President, ladies and gentlemen, this morning Parliament is called to approve a measure that closes an initial important stage in the European commitment against organized crime. In December 1996, the European Council of Dublin clearly expressed its determination to fight organized crime with a consistent and coordinated approach at European level.</p>
<p class="contents">This choice marks a turning‐point: it marks the transition from the stage of occasional intervention to the stage of fundamental intervention. The high‐level group, suitably established, has drawn up a global action plan, a plan drawn up firstly in fact by the Justice and Home Affairs Council that met in Luxembourg on 28 April 1997, and subsequently included in the overall definition drawn up by the European Council that met in Amsterdam in June 1997.</p>
<p class="contents">On 20 November 1997, Parliament gave its opinion on several important proposals for joint action, particularly on the punishment for belonging to a criminal organization and the establishment of a mechanism for assessing the implementation, at national level, of international initiatives adopted to fight organized crime. While the Council of Ministers launched the proposed action on the aforesaid assessment mechanism in December 1997, we are still waiting for the launch of the proposal on the punishment for belonging to a criminal organization.</p>
<p class="contents">We have certainly witnessed a strengthening of the EU strategy to fight organized crime and recognize the efforts made by certain individual countries, particularly Italy, in recent years. The programme, for which I am the rapporteur, takes its name from the judge, Giovanni Falcone, who was killed by the Mafia in 1992 with his wife and escorts and who now stands as a symbol of the fight against organized crime both within as well as outside Italy.</p>
<p class="contents">The programme proposes to strengthen judicial and police cooperation among those responsible for fighting the Mafia and grants finance for apprenticeships, seminars and operational projects, as well as research and training. The Committee on Civil Liberties and Internal Affairs proposes several amendments aimed at including, along with the institutional figures and the police, those responsible for the cultural climate and various expressions of civilian society, in the programme, thus emphasizing the importance of the cultural and social dimension in the fight against organized crime.</p>
<p class="contents">The involvement of schools, universities and non‐governmental organizations is considered to be important, as is the involvement of notaries, lawyers, accountants and auditors. In such cases of recourse to non‐institutional figures, there should also be a provision for the financial involvement of local government authorities, for supervisory purposes.</p>
<p class="contents">I consider the proposal made by several Members in the Group of the European People"s Party for specific support and initiatives in applicant countries to be particularly significant, confirming the need to provide this delicate sector with harmonious legislation and cultural awareness not only among the Member States but also among the states applying to join the EU.</p>
<p class="contents">To conclude, I would like to point out the importance of this measure: an importance that is certainly specific but that is also symbolic, because it assumes the many positive experiences of individual states to be a reference point in some way and it assumes the Italian experience to be a positive factor.</p>
<p class="contents">I think that what should be emphasized today is no longer an individual experience in an individual state but the perception and awareness, at European level, that we are faced with a phenomenon – the Mafia and organized crime – that constitutes a battle that we can either fight together or lose irreparably.</p>

 Mr President, ladies and gentlemen, the idea of actually bringing together people cooperating in the fight against organized crime in Europe, of training them together and of letting them gain experience together, is so undeniably desirable and necessary, that I support both this programme and Mr Orlando's report.</p>
<p class="contents">However, despite this basically positive view, I have a few critical comments to make about projects of this kind, although less so about this particular programme. This programme draws in a relatively large group of people from the European Union: judges, public prosecutors, police officers, customs officials, and so on. We can scarcely expect that with the limited funds available for this programme it will be possible to reach a significant number of people in the target groups. For that reason, I believe that we should limit the number of people involved and target the funding as far as possible.</p>
<p class="contents">Furthermore, we should not get carried away in defining possible subject areas. I personally have doubts about whether it makes sense to finance research projects from the limited funds available. We should also avoid things such as friendly weekend meetings coming under a programme of this kind.</p>
<p class="contents">We also need to remember that we already have a whole string of similar projects, so we must avoid duplication. For example, we have Matthaeus, a programme for customs officials. We also have Matthaeus Tax, Grotius, Stop, Oisin and so forth. We need to be very careful to make sure that these programmes do not overlap and that certain people who have a particular knack of getting on board such programmes do not get too many bites of the apple.</p>
<p class="contents">Then there is the question of funding: it was originally envisaged that European co‐financing would represent 80 %. The Committee on Budgets has suggested lowering this to 60 %. I personally would prefer to see 50 % financing, so that people making bids for funds would have to finance a significant proportion of these measures themselves. We have, in fact, opted for the 60 % proposed by the Committee on Budgets. One last thing: we need more stringent and specific checks on what happens to funds and the success rate of initiatives using these funds, and of course our Committee on Budgetary Control has a role to play here.</p>

 Mr President, I too would like to point out the importance of this programme and the vote we cast within the framework of a highly significant increase in attention, as well as proposals on the fight against organized crime. The name given to the programme, Falcone, is that of a judge who became well‐known, particularly after his death, for he was killed when he was in greatest difficulty and most isolated.</p>
<p class="contents">We should always remember that in fighting organized crime, along with an effective police and judicial action, it is very important to create a climate of commitment and watch‐keeping against organized crime. From this point of view, I have to say that Italy has been isolated for a long time. Our country, which has had to experience the effects of organized crime on its own people, as the Falcone case as well as the Borsellino and other cases have shown us, has had difficulty convincing Europe of the need for this priority. Fortunately, we can now see that this belief exists today, even if we are obviously far from satisfied with the results. For example, with the means that have been established and that are highly important with regard to organized crime, the joint actions are still ineffective!</p>
<p class="contents">In approving this programme, I would like to remind the Council and the Commission of the importance of using the means chosen, even if not by everyone, as we cannot implement everything at the same time; what has been chosen should be implemented, because the credibility of a European action that is finally becoming a joint action, a joint commitment against organized crime, is at stake.</p>
<p class="contents">With regard to the programme, I will limit myself to emphasizing the correctness of the two additions that have been proposed, those made by the members of the PPI on the extension to countries in the process of joining, and that proposed by Mr Orlando, who suggests using this programme to support the experience acquired in the field and, starting from local associations and institutions, managing to create the climate I was talking about earlier. Several months ago, the Italian association “Libera’, which groups together around 600 associations, held a very important and useful hearing in which we heard how important the work on education, prevention and awareness of the fight against crime was in creating the decisive alliances in society for an effective fight by the state authorities.</p>

 Mr President, organized crime is now actively targeting Europe. If we do not combat it strongly now, we are going to have to do so using drastic methods later. The action plan to combat organized crime shows that awareness of this serious threat to Europe is on its way to finding concrete expression.</p>
<p class="contents">In my report on organized crime, which was discussed by Parliament in November last year, I pointed out several areas in which cooperation needs to be strengthened. One of the most important areas concerns practical cooperation across borders. Practical cooperation towards common goals tends after a time to show what methods are the most effective. The Nordic countries have a long history of such a cooperation in the area of law. This has in fact led to systems which, if not identical, are certainly compatible. In the three Nordic countries which are in the Union, we have achieved many of the goals the Union is now trying to achieve jointly.</p>
<p class="contents">The Falcone programme is an important step on the path towards a successive coordination of European systems of criminal law and measures to combat crime. Such a coordination must evolve through practical cooperation. I am therefore in favour of the Commission's proposal which is based on training and exchange between judges, public prosecutors, customs and police. It is important that the professional circles are directly involved and receive this support amounting to ECU 10 million over five years, which is quite a modest sum in this regard.</p>
<p class="contents">In the long term the current distribution of Structural Funds is irrational and this should therefore lead to the legal infrastructure also getting some of the traditional Structural Funds.</p>
<p class="contents">I have opinions on some of the details in the programme, including the financing model. The Commission is proposing that 80 % of the costs should be financed from Community funds. But the usual principle in other cases is half and half, that is, 50 % from the Community and 50 % from the participating Member States. That model has advantages because the financial responsibility is shared and, more importantly, control is shared and can therefore be stronger. That is an important point in a Europe where the citizens occasionally doubt the fairness and effectiveness of EU subsidies. However, the Committee on Civil Liberties and Internal Affairs has agreed to compromise with the Commission and is proposing 60 % from Community funds.</p>
<p class="contents">I believe there is reason to look further and in the long term to also prepare the Falcone programme for participants not only from the applicant countries, but also from countries which share common borders with the applicant countries.</p>
<p class="contents">Finally, it is important to stress that the Falcone programme is only <span class="italic">one</span>
 of the first initiatives in a series of measures which are going to be required to improve the quality of legal systems, and to increase understanding and cooperation between people from crime‐fighting and judicial administrations in the Member States and applicant countries. If the aim of creating reliable legal systems in all of the Union's Member States is not achieved, then it is possible that the large gains which all the parties involved stand to make from enlargement might come to nothing. The legal structure within the Union must be successful, which means that we have to invest in it.</p>

 Mr President, thank you for that expression of solidarity with the speaker.</p>
<p class="contents">I would first like to thank Mr Orlando for his commitment to this work in memory of a judge. The programme bears the name of a judge who was a victim in the battle against the Mafia and who was killed so savagely.</p>
<p class="contents">I too believe that the adoption of the Falcone programme is a considerable step forwards, particularly with regard to the exchange of information between those acting in the fight against organized crime – police, judges and all others involved – which is increasingly more transnational and has knocked down frontiers.</p>
<p class="contents">It is important for the new countries wishing to join the EU to be involved, but the control of democracy is also very important. This is clearly stated in the Falcone programme: the European Parliament should establish control and the principles of personal guarantees, individual freedoms and equality between accusation and defence should not be forgotten, even in the fight against organized crime. The risk otherwise is that the exceptional laws, used to fight organized crime, may become ordinary laws, which would obviously be an enormous step backwards for the freedom and democracy of European citizens.</p>

 Mr President, according to a Eurobarometer survey, 70 % of European citizens think that decisions on combating drugs, crime and terrorism are better made at European than at national level. The citizens are right, of course. Cross‐border problems such as terrorism and crime require a global, joint approach with effective and coherent measures. The Falcone project forms part of this. It is, as has been said, one of the implementation measures in the action plan to combat organized crime, and currently, concrete interpretation of this is beginning.</p>
<p class="contents">As a result of the dramas which took place two years ago in my country, Belgium, a Parliamentary committee of inquiry was set up to find out what went wrong in the various judicial inquiries. One of the committee of inquiry"s final conclusions was that the failing judicial policy in Belgium could be primarily attributed to inadequate organization of our judicial system, a poignant lack of cooperation and coordination between the different police services, and the fact that the exchange of criminal information between judicial examining institutions is virtually non‐existent.</p>
<p class="contents">We must therefore categorically avoid Europe making the same mistakes which have led to the events in my country. This is exactly the reason why this Falcone project is so important. This five‐year programme is meant to combat organized crime in the European Member States through cross‐border exchange, training and cooperation among those responsible for combating it.</p>
<p class="contents">It is time we gave the European Union the necessary resources to act decisively on one of the biggest problems of our time: the guarantee of our security.</p>

 Mr President, we must warmly welcome the Falcone programme. It is a programme which, I too confirm, bears the name of an exceptional Italian judge, savagely killed several years ago. This programme, as a joint action plan against organized crime, is first and foremost a valuable and positive contribution towards a process of real European unification which, in addition to the currency, should also provide a common internal policy for the safety and protection of citizens. Despite that, in my opinion but also in that of other Members, the programme needs to define more rigorously and specifically its objectives, fields of application, methods of participation and financing, to avoid dissipating initiatives and wasting money.</p>
<p class="contents">Secondly, we need to confirm that, to have the desired effect, the Falcone programme should incorporate its operating initiatives into Europol"s field of application, particularly with regard to drug trafficking.</p>
<p class="contents">The Falcone programme, if it does not involve too many conferences and seminars, but concentrates on implementation, innovation of information systems and vocational training for employees and research, may provide a great possibility for the modernization and development of the systems for fighting crime, and, above all, a great service for European citizens and, as I said earlier, European unification.</p>

 Mr President, ladies and gentlemen, we have heard many sensible comments about the programme itself and about the suggestions made by Mr Orlando. I have a fundamental question: how should we go about fighting organized crime in the European Union in the long term?</p>
<p class="contents">The Falcone programme, whilst preserving national responsibility for combating crime, seems to mean that officials responsible for such matters at national level will exchange experience gained within their countries, only to go home again and carry on doing things at national level just as they were before the exchange of information. That will not get us anywhere in the long term. Although it is a good programme, and the exchange of experience is worthwhile, Mr De Clercq has made a very important point. Members of this House can at any time discuss the freedom of movement of organized crime, and the fact that the cross‐border activities that it involves are becoming increasingly easier, because we are talking about international economic activity within the large free trade area which the EU constitutes, to which we are now going to add a single currency.</p>
<p class="contents">We shall soon be adding consolidation of finance policy to economic consolidation and consolidation of trade. The practical scope for abusing this structure is becoming ever greater, but we are not fighting this with any EU counter‐strategy. That is why I believe the Falcone programme is desirable – if it is viewed as a preliminary stage of subsequently making the fight against crime Europewide, that is, fighting it at Community level. That would be a step in the right direction which we would warmly welcome. I would like us to bear this in mind for future debates.</p>

 Mr President, ladies and gentlemen, I agree with all the previous speakers who have said that organized crime has taken hold not only in the European Union, but worldwide, and I would like to quote a dramatic figure that makes the position very clear. The International Monetary Fund estimates that every year some ECU 550 billion generated by organized crime is transferred to the legal economy. We can all imagine what the implications are for legitimate companies, for state organizations and for society in general of transferring criminally‐generated money to the legal economy on this scale. It represents a massive threat to us all.</p>
<p class="contents">Our citizens think it is high time that the police and the judiciary matched the network set up by organized crime with a corresponding international network of their own. I agree with Mr Schulz that we should consider putting national sovereignty to one side in the interests of European justice and cooperation in the fight against crime. We must not allow our citizens to get the impression that European integration works in the interest of criminals rather than of ordinary citizens. So we must be clearly seen to be promoting European cooperation in the interests of citizens' safety.</p>
<p class="contents">This programme is a step in that direction, and I believe it would be much more valuable if this programme could benefit from cooperation with the many other programmes we have, such as Odysseus, Grotius or Sherlock. If we can manage to see the effects of cooperation with these programmes, then our citizens will really believe and sense that Europe is actually doing something in the interest of their safety, that Europe is not just a common economic area, but that it is also gradually becoming a common legal area and a common safety area!</p>

 Mr President, the initiative for a joint approach against organised crime under the symbolic name Falcone is obviously to be welcomed. Yet I wonder how, during the coming local and national elections which are held all over Europe, we will be able to explain to the citizens that an action plan with fifteen guidelines, thirty specific recommendations, to be evaluated after five years, and a committee involving a wide range of people with a small budget, will be able to inflict a definite blow to a criminal sector characterized by creativity and flexibility. The approach strikes me as too cumbersome, too bureaucratic even. Like Mr Nassauer, I would have preferred if it had been more limited, for example only to people who catch real criminals. Because then you can go to the European citizens and tell them that the approach against crime is successful.</p>

 Mr President, first I would like to congratulate Mr Orlando on a very thorough report. I value the support which the rapporteur is giving the Commission for this important initiative. Like Mr Schulz, the Commission hopes, of course, that the programme will mean further steps towards better European cooperation in the legal field, because Falcone is going to be significant in several ways. Among other things, the programme will offer a financial framework in which a majority of the recommendations adopted at the Summit in Amsterdam in connection with the action plan to combat organized crime are going to be implemented, and will monitor their implementation. As you know, the Cardiff European Council will monitor further how the work on the action plan is progressing. It is therefore, of course, particularly important that the Falcone programme gets going very quickly.</p>
<p class="contents">The Falcone programme is also going to substantially improve the conditions for cross‐border cooperation between public servants who work to combat organized crime in various ways in our Member States. In this way, contact between experts and people on the ground can be increased several times over.</p>
<p class="contents">As far as the Commission is concerned, I can note with satisfaction that it seems as if the amendments proposed in the report are all aimed at strengthening the proposal. Obviously it would be desirable if people affected by organized crime could be involved because these people have an important function, not least with regard to disseminating knowledge of the consequences of crossborder crime. However, I believe the important thing right now is that the Falcone programme is implemented and that in this way we make further concrete efforts to implement the action plan which has existed since the Amsterdam Summit.</p>

<p class="contents">I cannot provide an analysis of the respect for human rights in the fifteen countries of the Union in five minutes. A detailed study of the rulings of the European Court of Human Rights, of the petitions and of the NGOs all confirm the progress which remains to be achieved in order to be consistent with the commitments decreed by the international instruments for protection of human rights, whether it be the Charter of the United Nations, the Universal Declaration of Human Rights or even the two International Covenants on Civil and Political Rights and Economic, Social and Cultural Rights. Without being exhaustive, let me also mention the decisions of the conferences in Vienna in June 1993, Copenhagen and Beijing in 1995, and finally that of Stockholm in 1996 concerning child exploitation.</p>
<p class="contents">If I insist on this overall framework, it is because it has concerned the European Union for many years, and it would be ridiculous for Parliament to refuse to recognize the indivisibility and interdependence of human rights. I know there is a strong temptation on the part of some of our colleagues not to recognize economic and social rights. To remain the last circle of diehards regarding this question would deal a blow to our credibility both inside and outside the Union. Would we reject the Universal Declaration of 1948 which stipulates, in Article 22, that “everyone, as a member of society, has the right to social security, and is entitled to realization...of the economic, social and cultural rights indispensable for his dignity and the free development of his personality’? Would we disregard Father Joseph Wresinski"s analysis, the founder of ATD Fourth World, who forcefully declared that, “wherever people are condemned to live in misery, human rights are violated; to join together to ensure their respect is a sacred duty’?</p>
<p class="contents">So, this is our duty today, when the European Union has 18 million unemployed, more than 57 million living in poverty and more than 2 million homeless! But to this scourge must be added, on occasion, the misfortune of not being European. Too many Member States have misguidedly linked the issue of unemployment with that of immigration. Thus, daily racism, which is insidious but daring to display itself in the proper and figurative sense of the word, has increased to dangerous levels in our countries. I could quote you many figures in this respect, or rulings of the European Court of Human Rights, such as the ruling in the case of Ahmed against Austria, Chahal against the United Kingdom, or Gaygusuz or Remli against France, and many more.</p>
<p class="contents">We must fight racism with all our strength, but also by example. This is why I am requesting the Committee on the Rules of Procedure, the Verification of Credentials and Immunities to impose sanctions on Members who make racist comments whilst exercising their function as a Member of Parliament.</p>
<p class="contents">I would also like to sound an alarm and to condemn the municipal councils governed by the National Front in France, which are putting the right to culture and information in danger by withdrawing books from libraries, abolishing grants and demanding the closure of cultural centres such as Château‐Vallon in Toulon.</p>
<p class="contents">Measures must be taken to guarantee respect for cultural rights and to thwart the enemies of liberty who intend to make their cultural order supreme.</p>
<p class="contents">I would also have very much liked to talk about women"s rights and the rights of children, the right of asylum, the often terrible conditions of detention in our countries, the lack of respect for sexual orientation and so on. We must be on the alert for all of these violations and this lack of strict respect for human rights. We must be unceasing in our endeavours, since the future of peoples and of humanity is our responsibility.</p>
<p class="contents">Let us remember Félix Gualtari"s warning, which he gave shortly before his death in 1992: “in different forms, a micro‐fascism is growing in the pores of our society, showing itself through racism, xenophobia, the revival of religious fundamentalism, militarism and the oppression of women. History guarantees no irreversible clearing of a progressive barrier. Only human practice, a collective will, can protect us from falling once more into the worst barbarities. In this respect, it would be totally illusory to fall back on the formal constraints of human and people"s rights. Rights are not guaranteed by a divine authority. They depend on the energy of the institutions and formations of power which support their existence’.</p>
<p class="contents">So having proclaimed them, let us have the courage to make these rights a reality.</p>

 Mr President, ladies and gentlemen, the starting point for this opinion was our criticism of the 1997 human rights report. We agreed to refer the various topics discussed to the specialist committees and to restrict ourselves to actual infringements of human rights, because we believed that human rights as a whole, and this matter in particular, would be better served in that way. I therefore prepared an opinion as part of the draft report and presented it to the Committee on Employment and Social Affairs with precisely this in mind.</p>
<p class="contents">I investigated the infringements that had taken place in 1996 and discovered that in the field of social rights connected with nondiscrimination there had only been an infringement of the European Convention for the Protection of Human Rights in one country: in this case a social‐welfare benefit had been linked to a requirement by the public prosecution service. This misunderstanding has already been corrected in the country involved. I also investigated the extent to which the Council of Europe's Social Charter had been infringed in the corresponding areas, and established that there had been infringements in all countries in respect of trade unions and employees, although I must add that the Social Charter is of a declamatory, recommendatory nature.</p>
<p class="contents">I have drawn two conclusions from these infringements. The first is that infringements should be avoided where they occur and that adjustments should be made to national legal provisions. The second is that Member States should be called upon to make recommendations to ensure compliance with the provisions of the Social Charter in the areas of forced labour, freedom of association and the right to strike.</p>
<p class="contents">This proposal was accepted in the first debate, but during the second debate a great many amendments were tabled, which all pointed in the same direction as in previous years. I therefore voted against my own report for the following reasons, and I am now speaking as a member of the European People's Party: these amendments meant that the objective of focusing on a real discussion of human rights infringements was not achieved. We went down the same path as in previous years. The human rights report was used as a vehicle for peddling left‐wing ideological ideas in this Parliament, ideas that no‐one has any time for any more, because they are unrealistic, often obscure and above all unsuccessful.</p>
<p class="contents">Human rights are too important to be treated as an ideological football. If the human rights report turns into a theoretical discourse on Marxist economic theories, calls for unacceptable migration policies and denounces child protection provisions as antihomosexual laws, then the report just has to be rejected.</p>

 Mr President, ladies and gentlemen, until a few moments ago I was looking forward to an intellectually stimulating debate. Mr Pirker, the comments you made at the end did nothing to enhance your otherwise very good speech. So I am looking forward to other Members' comments, because we cannot justify reducing the human rights debate to little more than the level of bar‐room politics.</p>
<p class="contents">You cannot tackle the problems that we have to confront every year in the way Mr Pirker has just done. Every year we are unfortunately at loggerheads in this House about the human rights report and about the human rights situation within the European Union. When we come to vote it will be another example of trench warfare virtually incomprehensible to the outsider, because most people believe that there is no need to argue about human rights, because we should be able to work on the assumption that there is a basic consensus on this issue amongst democratic politicians, which covers most, if not all of those in this House. However, this basic consensus no longer exists in practice. It no longer exists because a few years ago some groups in this House embarked on a process of trying to find definitions of human rights which go beyond the traditional concept of human rights in the sense of civil rights, which must be definable in modern states such as the Member States of the Union in terms of fundamental ecological, social and cultural rights.</p>
<p class="contents">I would like to make one thing clear on behalf of my group: the Member States of the European Union, as highly modern, rich, efficiently administered, and, in terms of educational standards, highly developed states, are of course different from the states covered in our human rights reports. Mr Goerens gave a good example a few days ago, on child mortality. We cannot formulate a constitutional right concerning the protection of the new‐born child against all possible dangers in a country like Guinea‐Bissau, because the state simply cannot finance what is needed in terms of infrastructure, hygiene and sanitation there. But in a country like Germany, the state can finance them. In Germany, every new‐born child can be cared for in optimal conditions. So that in my country a family believes it can rightly claim this kind of protection, regardless of its own particular social situation, in contrast to a family in that African country.</p>
<p class="contents">This difference in prosperity alone indicates that we need a new debate. Another issue is whether what we are demanding here will eventually lead to fundamental rights of this kind being embodied somewhere. However, it would be wrong not to have this debate. In particular, the Group of the European People's Party tries every year to derail this debate on the basis that it has nothing to do with civil rights, with human rights. Wrong! It has everything to do with those rights.</p>
<p class="contents">Furthermore, we in this House cannot afford – and this has been said often enough already, but it needs to be said again – to point the finger of blame at all sorts of human rights abuses all over the world, drawing up resolutions and generally lamenting the situation, if at the same time we refuse to talk about the torture, rape, suppression, abuse and psychological terrorism practised by the institutions of the European Union and its Member States. That would deprive us of any moral legitimacy in making accusations of human rights infringements in other parts of the world. For that very reason we need to be particularly alert to human rights abuses within the European Union itself.</p>
<p class="contents">I know that all this is very unpleasant if you proclaim your country to be a democratic and constitutionally governed state, but protecting fundamental rights is more difficult in practice than writing paper constitutions. Yet a democratic and constitutionally governed state that does not strive every single day to ensure that its constitution is not a mere symbol but an everyday reality is bound to lose its own legitimacy.</p>

 Mr President, ladies and gentlemen, once again we are faced with a report which unfortunately fails to focus on the real and legal aspects of respect for human rights in the European Union. Once again we find ourselves looking at a project whose content and structure have been spoiled, probably because of motives – perhaps political – other than those which should shape this document"s objectives.</p>
<p class="contents">It seems people need reminding that Parliament"s resolutions are the resolutions of a legislative assembly, and we cannot approve reports which lack a legal base and are a response simply to political and programmatical aims. It is our duty to endow these resolutions with a strict respect for ideological impartiality and for the law in its widest sense. That is why we in the Group of the European People"s Party have been calling for absolute respect for our original law: the Treaty. We have always stood up for our duty to use as a basis the European Convention on Human Rights, which was signed in Rome. Unfortunately, however, we are faced with a report which confuses the most basic principles of the law, and fails to make a distinction between basic law and Member States" obligations towards their citizens.</p>
<p class="contents">We in the Group of the European People"s Party reaffirm our tradition of being in the forefront of the defence of human rights. We repeat our absolute respect for the dignity and value of the person, and the equal rights of men and women. And we repeat that all human rights are universal, indivisible and independent. So in this report we will vote in favour of those paragraphs which actually reflect human rights problems, such as individual freedoms, the rights of the defendant, political rights or the right to life. We share the concern to promote and protect children"s rights and to guarantee the protection of the rights of people who may be particularly vulnerable to mistreatment or abandonment, including the young, the disabled and the elderly. Nevertheless, we will have to oppose those paragraphs of the report which fail to respect the concept of human rights.</p>
<p class="contents">This House cannot be used to approve resolutions which attempt to use the subject matter for political ends, especially when those subjects are as sensitive as fundamental rights. In the future we must reconsider the structure and content of this sort of report, so that we can act with the greatest possible consensus on such a serious issue as this. To do that, perhaps we will need to be able to organize hearings with the judges of the European Court of Human Rights, so they can tell us which are the commonest types of appeals made by our citizens before the Council of Europe, and assess the sentences delivered during the year and examined by the report, or establish other methods for dialogue to allow us to study human rights from a common perspective.</p>
<p class="contents">Therefore, Mr President, before I finish I want to say that I hope and trust that common sense will prevail in future debates on these problems, and that the political groups will be able to forget their differences for the sake of the people of Europe, in a matter as important as human rights.</p>

 Mr President, on reading Mrs Pailler"s report on human rights in the European Union, one can but be divided between two contradictory attitudes: being impressed, on the one hand, by the work that has been carried out and, on the other, exasperated by its litany. In effect, this report has become a sort of exercise in style, almost a catalogue of catch‐alls, a mixture of incantatory affirmations, good intention and disjointed imprecations.</p>
<p class="contents">Who would dare to affirm without batting an eyelid that they were hostile to a total respect for human rights, that the European Union, and thus its Member States, should not keep guard over the respect for freedom of thought, of conscience and of religion? Why are such paragraphs here, if not to try to get the backing of as many Members as possible regarding this text and in the process to get far more questionable paragraphs adopted? Can we reasonably admit that the duties of the individual are not tied to any obligations? Can we imagine rights without duties? This is the ideal that Mrs Pailler is trying to get passed.</p>
<p class="contents">A tendency towards generalization is too often noted in this report. All homosexuals are persecuted, all employers of household staff are pro‐slavery, all members of the forces of law and order are nothing but grim brutes and all prisoners have to undergo inhuman medical examinations. Furthermore, the report omits to mention a whole series of rights which do not appear fundamental in the eyes of the rapporteur: the right to live in security, to come and go as you please, to go out in the evening without fear, to know that your property, often acquired through much hard work, will not be stolen, for parents to know that their children will not fall prey to sexual or mental diseases or the right of victims to claim fair compensation. The report contains no less than twelve paragraphs on the situation of prisoners, but regarding the victims, not a word!</p>
<p class="contents">Finally, this report, if considered from the outside, gives a totally negative image of the situation of human rights in the Union. Of course, nothing is perfect, but this should encourage our Parliament, which sets itself up as the universal censor, to show less arrogance.</p>
<p class="contents">Nevertheless, until citizens of the European Union start emigrating to Algeria, Cuba or Afghanistan, while our Member States remain the object of so many requests for asylum and while they have to protect themselves against such high levels of illegal immigration, I remain reassured about our record!</p>

 Mr President, ladies and gentlemen, the European Year against Racism was another opportunity for us to confirm that nothing is ever definitively gained with regard to respect for others, their dignity, their differences and their cultural identity. This is one of the main reasons that justifies the holding of an annual debate on human rights in the European Union.</p>
<p class="contents">A second reason relates to Europe"s situation in the world. The rights of minorities, the flood of people requesting asylum and the situation of illegal immigrants are all making Europe seem like a permanent construction site and thus an area in which respect for human rights must be affirmed.</p>
<p class="contents">In this respect, Europe must try to be irreproachable, for it is not sufficient to include a clause regarding respect for human rights in all agreements between the European Union and third countries. The Union, which wants to include the said clause in its agreements, must first of all prove its good conduct within its own borders.</p>
<p class="contents">The Liberals have always favoured a wide debate on the inclusion of second and third generation rights into the reports relating to human rights. Given their progressive nature and the need for codification, we advocate their inclusion as well as the continuation of the compilation of the reports that we have presented on this issue.</p>
<p class="contents">The European Union is only credible in this field if it is open to self‐criticism. Indeed, the control and follow‐up mechanisms put in place by the Council of Europe in the area of human rights are a permanent invitation to vigilance on the part of Member States and their citizens.</p>
<p class="contents">It is in relation to the weak, the marginalized and the most vulnerable members of our society that our desire to respect human rights is measured. Considered from this point of view, the work accomplished by Mrs Pallier is excellent and is worthy of our full consideration.</p>

 Mr President, first of all I would like to congratulate the rapporteur on her excellent report, and express my full support for each and every one of the proposals included in it.</p>
<p class="contents">Having said that, I would like to focus my short speech on the fight against racism and xenophobia. Racism is a crime and, without losing sight of that fact, the Member States need to strengthen their laws to combat all types of racist acts or statements. It is often said that unemployment and economic crisis are the very worst conditions for fostering racism and xenophobia, and that is not untrue. However, we must not forget that social exclusion has a strong cultural component. Both these factors should be taken into account in the fight against racism.</p>
<p class="contents">Finally, I should like to draw attention to the novel suggestion Mrs Pailler makes in her report: that the European Parliament itself could act against any Members who promote racism or xenophobia in any way. We need to do away with what some people call institutional xenophobia, and with measures like this I think we are on the right track.</p>

 Mr President, ladies and gentlemen, millions of people, for an unlimited period – limited perhaps only by their death – have only a few rights: the right to misery, or to misery sooner or later, frequently the right to lose the roof over their heads and lose any social respect and any self‐respect, apart from an uncertain or failed identity, and the right to that most basic of feelings, shame. These are the words of Viviane Forester.</p>
<p class="contents">What we need is a renaissance of fundamental rights, of human rights here in the European Union. We must put a stop to the carelessness with which basic democratic principles are challenged. In practice, we are living in an era in which democratic processes and solidarity are dwindling. The foundation for human rights here is not stable, it is starting to crumble and to break up. So the annual report on human rights is all the more important, and it is all the more easy to understand the reasons for what has now become a traditional ideological debate on the definition of human rights and the repeated attempts to reduce, diminish, and relativize it.</p>
<p class="contents">A report on human rights has to deal with the unvarnished truth and nothing else. I really wish that Christian‐Democrat Members like Mr Pirker would reflect on what the major churches regard as fundamental rights. They demand the right to work, the right to dignified work. They call for justice in society, justice as regards equitable distribution of wealth and holding a stake in society. A state which refuses the homeless the right to vote and the right to have a say, is refusing them the right to human dignity, since an important part of the concept of democracy is that the right to share in decision‐making is not linked to any other criterion except that of simply being a human being – it has nothing to do with gender, skin colour or how much money you have in the bank.</p>
<p class="contents">Rights are there to be exercised. It is a cynical distortion to talk about the misuse of rights and to attack exercising rights as misuse. We hear the word “misuse’ everywhere – “misuse’ of the right to asylum, “misuse’ of social protection, “misuse’ of journalists' right not to reveal their sources. And Mr Pirker talks about misuse here in this House, when we are discussing human rights.</p>
<p class="contents">So we must ensure that we guarantee the freedom to exercise rights instead of attacking “misuse’. That is what democracy is all about. I do not have enough time to mention individual cases, Mr President. I would have liked to talk about Austria and discrimination against homosexuals. I would have liked to talk about Germany and the contemptuous treatment of refugees in that country. That is what a human rights report should be about, not about constructing an empty façade.</p>

 Mr President, we will of course vote for Aline Pallier"s report. Certainly human rights, the definition of which everyone is agreed upon, must be promoted and we should all be amongst the first to fight to have them respected. But the vital importance of economic and social rights must be insisted upon. It is somewhat indecent to use the rapporteur"s membership of a certain group as a pretext to challenge the content of paragraphs dealing with these rights. Nobody would consider challenging the right of a couple to have children or not, so what about the right of a family to give their children a minimum education, to guarantee them good physical and mental health and to give them the minimum means for development?</p>
<p class="contents">The way in which our world is organized, whereby in the Union more and more money is produced along with more and more poor people, must be very closely scrutinized, for the violation of these basic human rights is the daily bread of life in the European Union today. So, in order to promote rights that we were once able to describe as definitive, a minimum basis of respect for men and women is necessary. It is on this basis that we will be able to witness the development of a harmonious society. The right to live in dignity is a very strict minimum.</p>

 Mr President, the annual report on respect for human rights in the European Union is a ritual to which all members of this House must be able to sacrifice without hesitation, in particular we French, since it was a Frenchman, King Louis XVI, who was the first European to promulgate a declaration of the rights of man and citizen.</p>
<p class="contents">Unfortunately, after reading what has been submitted to us, we can but remain sceptical. Is it a text on respect for human rights or a political manifesto from a member of the French Communist Party?</p>
<p class="contents"><span class="italic"><span class="italic">(Protests)</span> </span></p>
<p class="contents">Mrs Pallier insists on economic and social rights but is strangely silent on the right to institute proceedings and the right to property, which are nevertheless fundamental in the fight against poverty and exclusion.</p>
<p class="contents">That said, apart from the articles concerning children"s rights, which can be unreservedly supported, and a certain number of articles on freedom of expression and individual freedoms, the report which has been submitted to us is more or less composed of largely tendentious ideological affirmations, with a strong hint of Marxism‐Leninism, ...</p>
<p class="contents"><span class="italic"><span class="italic">(Mixed reactions)</span> </span></p>
<p class="contents">... a criminal ideology responsible for more than 100 million deaths in Europe since 1917. Under these conditions, it is clear that it will be impossible for us to vote for the majority of the articles in this report, which mix political affirmation with true questions regarding human rights. On the other hand, we will support the UPE and PPE amendments.</p>
<p class="contents">In conclusion, we consider that such a text, far from confirming the European Parliament"s role as vigilant guardian of human rights, can only give an image of an irresponsible House which tragically lacks gravity.</p>

 Mr President, the symbolism is strong, and as my colleague, Mr Buffetaut, has highlighted, it is scandalous. Our Parliament made Mrs Pailler responsible for the annual report on human rights, an elected communist, elected to the French Communist Party"s list, a party which continues to hold a Marxist definition of rights.</p>
<p class="contents">So a lesson on human rights has been given to us by the representative of a group who approved of Solzhenitsyn being sent to the Gulag, of the Berliners fleeing the Soviet paradise being fired upon by the East German People"s Police and of the military invasion of Afghanistan. And the French Communist Party has not repented. They continue to defend their position, for in the municipalities which they govern there are “Lenin’ streets everywhere, that is, roads, boulevards and avenues honouring one of the greatest criminals humanity has ever known: the creator of the Soviet secret police, the Cheka, and the theoretician, as well as practician, of the use of famine to bring down the numbers of political adversaries or the reputedly hostile classes.</p>
<p class="contents">Thus, ladies and gentlemen, we are today in the middle of a debate worthy of George Orwell"s novel, “1984’. We are in an Orwellian logic where truth is lies for, under the pretence of defending human rights, the issue is really one of depriving political adversaries of their freedom of expression. For freedom of expression is not the freedom to think as everyone else does, but the freedom to think differently from others. As Voltaire said, “I do not share your ideas, but I will fight for your right to express them’.</p>
<p class="contents">Similarly, Mrs Pallier"s report, under the guise of human rights, relates, in fact, to depriving people of their right to selfdetermination by controlling their immigration policy.</p>

 Mr President, I only have a few minutes, so I will not devote them to the sad remarks by Mr Buffetaut and Mr Le Gallou who year after year use this platform to insult the rapporteur instead of sticking to what it says in Mrs Pailler"s report.</p>
<p class="contents">The fact that we have such a report on an annual basis is a good thing: firstly, because we want to show that we are a decent continent; secondly, because we are alert enough to point at others when their human rights policy is no good; and thirdly because, during this week of all weeks, we are not only discussing Burma, Senegal and China, which is terrible enough in itself, but because we are also looking at what is not right here, and a lot of things are not right here. It is right that we are giving this matter our attention.</p>
<p class="contents">It is unfortunate and disgraceful, I also have to say, that year after year we differ in our opinion on the definition of the term human rights. I think it is therefore good that the committee I chair has decided to start next year by agreeing a definition, since a new generation of human rights is to be presented in June. It would be good if we took a very close look at the wording which is used there.</p>
<p class="contents">But before then, I would like to advise everyone to have a good look at chapters such as those on asylum and migration, and to have a good look at the chapters devoted to racism and xenophobia. If this report is taken seriously and if there is a desire for the outside world to understand that the European Parliament is also prepared to look at itself, this report will have to be agreed on the basis of these three chapters alone.</p>

 Mr President, ladies and gentlemen, we should not fool ourselves: this debate does not reflect any credit on the European Parliament. This is not because there is a stormy debate about a report, nor is it because we cannot reach a basic consensus on human rights issues. There is no reason why such a consensus should not exist. Nor should the concept of human rights be limited to classic civil liberties. The two major conventions on human rights already include social rights, so that should not be a problem.</p>
<p class="contents">No, I think that the problem is that, up to now, very few rapporteurs have been able to resist the temptation to bestow the title ‚human rights’ on their own personal political agenda, and to ask us to approve it. Mrs Pailler has not been able to resist this temptation either. I will cite just two examples. In the case of asylum seekers, which Mrs d'Ancona has just referred to, Mrs Pailler demands that the <span class="italic">jus soli</span>
 principle should be recognized without exception as from birth, and that dual nationality should be granted. There are good reasons for arguing this, but it certainly has nothing at all to do with human rights.</p>
<p class="contents">I would also like to mention economic and social rights. In this case, Mrs Pailler says that the extent of poverty in Europe, coupled with a rigid policy of controlling government spending, is aggravating unemployment. If you carry on talking about unemployment as a consequence of spending controls and of restructuring budgets, my dear Mrs Pailler, you will end up pretty much out on a limb, as you will by saying that the process of impoverishment is directly connected with the way the economy works.</p>
<p class="contents">It is easy to find fault with this criticism of the way the market economy works, but it certainly has nothing to do with human rights. Let us go back to human rights proper and talk, for instance, about what Mr Schulz said. I am referring to the psychological terrorism practised by the EU institutions, an interesting turn of phrase. Whatever does he mean? Mr van Miert's competition policy perhaps? We should talk about specific cases for once, then we might even agree on a human rights report.</p>

 I have to say that Mrs Pailler"s report is a very broad report, too broad even, given the problems this hotchpotch and jumble of laws obviously causes, which need to be discussed together. I should, however, examine several important points of the report, such as those relating to the question of prisons – an opinion which I fully share – and that relating to the abuse of detention and the lack of equality between accusation and defence in legal proceedings: these are all points made in this report which we share.</p>
<p class="contents">However, I am not going to join in the ideological debate on whether we need to include other rights in this report, extending the scope of human rights, such as economic and social or ecological rights. In this respect, I would like my friends in the People"s Party to know that this is not the point. I think that human rights are developing, and that we need to dispute the contents of Mrs Pailler"s report: for example, in the part relating to economic and social rights, the answers given by Mrs Pailler are totally wrong, obsolete and superseded by history. To say that poverty is the result of market policies does not take the actual facts into account and gives a contrary answer to reality itself. This is what we are fighting against.</p>

 Mr President, I would like to join the chorus of those who think it is a good thing that we are discussing and making decisions about the human rights situation within the European Union. I would like to add that it would be important if we in this House could reach a large majority on this point.</p>
<p class="contents">In my view the report contains many good things – let there be no misunderstanding on this – but it also contains a few issues which stand in the way of reaching a large majority. I mention just a few, not too many, as I do not have much time.</p>
<p class="contents">A fundamental issue is paragraph 14, for example, which deals with nationality right, with the jus soli, or jus sanguinis. These are issues which have a constitutional dimension in various Member States and my question is: we might say we are in favour of the jus soli, but is it a violation of human rights in 1996, because that is the year the report covers, if one country has a different system of nationality right? Obviously the answer is no.</p>
<p class="contents">It also contains a few good paragraphs on immigration and asylum policy, but it also has the odd controversial paragraph, like the one on legalizing illegal foreigners. Non‐legalization in itself was no violation of human rights during 1996. I hope it will be possible that by amending the report we will have a decent majority.</p>

 Mr President, Mrs Pailler has done an excellent job in preparing this important report. An annual report on human rights is something of a barometer to measure the current situation in various Member States.</p>
<p class="contents">Romanies and travellers make up a significant minority common to the whole of Europe. They have lived in Europe for centuries. Nonetheless, their rights are being flagrantly dashed to pieces still today in many states. Their basic economic, social and cultural rights are being ignored.</p>
<p class="contents">It is a great shame that the Council of Europe and the European Union are unable to achieve better cooperation with Romany people to improve living conditions for them. The Council is extremely knowledgeable concerning the Romany situation throughout Europe, but is greatly lacking in resources. By combining their strengths and resources the EU and the Council could achieve great results. I appeal to Commissioner van de Broek for greater cooperation.</p>

<p class="contents">Injustice of this kind is not the fault of officials or courts, but rather the result of poor law‐making, which has transformed fundamental rights into privileges.

 Mr President, along with some legitimate aspects and very useful reminders, this report on human rights in the European Union has a number serious gaps and unacceptable points.</p>
<p class="contents">For example, the mistaken concept of regulated prostitution, which would be a true regression for European humanism, a humanism for which the body is not exterior to the person and cannot be the object of commerce and which, if it were accepted, would contribute to spreading the scourge of prostitution in all its forms.</p>
<p class="contents">Secondly, the demand for civil union contracts for homosexuals. Do we need to be reminded of the obvious? Life and the development of society, of any society, is based on the difference between the sexes. A homosexual orientation, which is an individual practice, cannot claim social recognition and thus generate individual rights which would create confusion amongst the young in particular, in terms of the basic reference point of the difference between the sexes.</p>
<p class="contents">Finally, where is there mention about the most scorned right in our countries, especially in my own, in France, at the moment, thanks to which we are all here, both you and I, since it was granted to all of us: the right to develop and to be born?</p>
<p class="contents">Truly, Madam, in such a report we would have liked a less selective and more coherent approach.</p>

 Mr President, we would find it helpful if the human rights report dealt with specific cases and did not attempt to articulate a broad sweep of political demands. Its artificially over‐inflated scope simply weakens the report. The rapporteur's concerns are in many areas far removed from reality. The criticism of prison staff, to name just one example, is wide of the mark in many Member States. In fact, in Austria we recently had a plea for help from guardians of the law, who are overloaded because of the tolerant approach increasingly being adopted, and whose working conditions, which are deteriorating all the time, need to be investigated.</p>
<p class="contents">The inherent contradictions in the report are demonstrated by the fact that it calls both for better protection against dangerous criminals and simultaneously for improved rights for law‐breakers and for alternatives to imprisonment. Particularly at a time when we are generally welcoming the integration of national parliaments, I do not think it is very helpful to interfere with national legislative powers and make unjustified criticisms. For these reasons, we shall not be voting for the report.</p>

I appeal to anyone who has any degree of mental flexibility in the PPE and the ELDR groups to reflect on whether they ought not support a report which rightly emphasizes that human rights stretch well beyond fundamental civil rights, such as of freedom of religion and freedom of expression. Issues like poverty, homelessness and unemployment are equally denials of human rights, and we should say so.</p>
<p class="contents">I particularly want to refer to three paragraphs which deal with what are perhaps rather minor issues but are nevertheless very important to the people affected by them and which I am delighted to find in this report. Firstly, paragraph 57 refers to the plight of a number of domestic servants brought in outside the usual immigration rules by wealthy people, who then keep them in nearslavery with bad conditions and very poor – if any – wages. It is hard for them to do anything about this because if they leave their employer they would be deported. That is a situation that needs to be put right.</p>
<p class="contents">Then there is paragraph 89 which spells out the problem of children who are legally resident in the European Union but whose parents are not EU citizens. They often have considerable difficulties at border controls when they go on school trips and that puts them in an invidious position as compared with their classmates. That too needs to be put right.</p>
<p class="contents">Finally, I refer to paragraph 99 which highlights the difficulties which are often experienced by people held for long periods on remand in countries other than their own on suspicion of having committed an offence. Of course if they have, they should be prosecuted and punished but not held for long periods and then often freed because of bureaucratic problems like difficulties in translation or in reconciling the judicial systems of Member States. That is an important consideration too. There is very much in this report that deserves our support and I hope it will be adopted by Parliament.</p>

 Mr President, the first words of the Universal Declaration on Human Rights, whose fiftieth anniversary we celebrate this year, form the basis of freedom, justice and peace in the world as they recognize the dignity of every being belonging to the human family.</p>
<p class="contents">These first words of the Declaration have already been commented on many times to emphasize its originality compared with the previous declarations on rights in France, America and England, since 1215; this Declaration aims to be a peace plan and not just a legal limit to the sovereign"s power, and aims to give an answer to the thousand‐year‐old problem of justice that is often confused with the force of those with power.</p>
<p class="contents">It is therefore very important to examine the meaning of these words in depth. In my opinion, the report we are voting on contains many positive parts but also a negative part because it omits the fundamental question of who the members of the human family are to which these first words of the Universal Declaration refer.</p>
<p class="contents">Only by answering this question can we give strength and certainty to the principle of equality. We are all equal, but who is equal? It has already been said that wealth, health, intelligence, age and size do not count. In this House, however, we have to have courage to talk about humans at the beginning of their lives: the unborn children. In using this expression “unborn children’, I am using the language of the 1989 Convention on the Rights of the Child which states that “...the child...needs special safeguards and care...before as well as after birth’ in the preamble.</p>
<p class="contents">This language is therefore that of the international charters; silence is unacceptable! This obviously does not mean that we should not review the legislations that have given rise to disputes, but means that we need to affirm rights and at least talk about education, assistance and sharing. It is not enough to declare that we are against discrimination; instead, we must ensure that we do not discriminate between what Mother Teresa of Calcutta called the poorer from the poor!</p>

The case of Roísin McAliskey who is currently on conditional bail in a secure psychiatric hospital cannot be ignored and has not been ignored in this report.</p>
<p class="contents">Paragraph 106 of the resolution is welcome. The practice of tying up and handcuffing prisoners during gynaecological examinations or after giving birth is abhorrent. It has no place in our society and amounts to torture. It has driven Roísin, who I believe to be innocent, to the edge of insanity. The physical and mental suffering which she has undergone amounts to torture. She has suffered enough. I want to appeal to the British Presidency and to the German Government to release her immediately.</p>
<p class="contents">On the issue of human rights, I appeal to the British Presidency yet again not to break up the peace talks in Ireland, no matter what the provocation – and there has been provocation by both sides. Human rights demand that all involved in the search for peace continue that search by talks. I appeal, from the bottom of my heart, and on behalf of all Irish people, to the British Presidency not to break up the talks taking place in Dublin at the moment.</p>

 Mr President, first of all I would like to congratulate Mrs Pailler and also to give her particular thanks for the comprehensiveness of the report she has presented to the European Parliament.</p>
<p class="contents">I think what has disturbed and is disturbing some colleagues is the reference to economic, social and cultural rights, which they do not classify as human rights. Let me say that the issue is not a technical, but an ideological one, a political and ultimately a humanistic one. And that is what disturbs some, while I, if you will allow me ladies and gentlemen, am disturbed by the hypocrisy that often emerges, even in this House, when we see the most rudimentary human rights being suppressed all around us and we do nothing about it. At this very moment a new genocide is being attempted against the children of the Iraqi people. When will we cry out? When will we clamour against it, granted that this attack coincides with the European Parliament's debate on human rights? When will we repudiate this attack which offends against human rights?</p>

 Mr President, I too in my turn want to congratulate Mrs Pailler on her report. The 20th century is drawing to a close and we see, with real sorrow, that the violation of human rights is not an unfortunate ‚prerogative’ of some remote and new states but, sadly, takes place in our own countries.</p>
<p class="contents">Ladies and gentlemen, daily life itself and especially the development of technology show up new aspects of the suppression of basic personal and social citizens' rights, related to the right to work and to private life. That is why we ought, if we want to retain a level of respect for personal rights, to broaden the concept of personal rights with sensitivity and an open mind, so that we can deal with the new forms of violation threatening those rights. And Mrs Pailler has contributed much in that area. We also ought to look into the methods and timing of our reports. We are often overtaken by events, with the result that our reports are not topical so that the level of interest in public opinion is reduced and, in particular, governments are given the opportunity to ignore the reports and avoid complying with the European Parliament's recommendations. Besides, I believe that the annual report should be followed up and that we should monitor the way in which the governments respond to our observations about improving the situation or going ahead with legislation. Today, when the clouds of fascism and xenophobia abound in our countries and threaten acquired democratic rights of citizens, the European Parliament must not remain content with an annual report. We must find ways to exert pressure on governments which ignore our positions and views.</p>
<p class="contents">I would like to say to Mrs Pailler, who has heard some voices raised on the opposite side, that at times Liebknecht must have heard similar things. He made a speech in the German parliament and was applauded by his opponents. And when he stood down, he said: ’how mistaken I have been!’ You, Mrs Pailler, have made no mistake at all.</p>

 Mr President, ladies and gentlemen, the subject of fundamental rights is crucial and, indeed, constitutes a prime factor of the European identity and of European integration. In this regard, I am much gratified by three recent developments that carry us in the right direction: the progress achieved in Amsterdam, particularly regarding non‐discrimination; the designation of 1997 as European Year against Racism; and the recent success of Pope John Paul II"s actions in Cuba to further a freedom that is perhaps the first of all freedoms – that of opinion, and the spiritual freedom inherent in it.</p>
<p class="contents">While Mrs Pailler"s report is informed by a different philosophy, it nonetheless presents many positive points which we can support. However, in other regards, it goes too far, or adopts an approach that is not the most appropriate for a document in the nature of an annual report for the European Parliament, which should be more informative than prescriptive, more legal than political, more of a statement of accounts and act of transparency and more consensual, although no less rigorous for all that. Otherwise, it cannot contribute to forging a genuine European identity in such a crucial sphere as that of fundamental rights.</p>
<p class="contents">I further consider that the report should concentrate more attention on rights of a personal nature, which constitute the backbone of the European Convention on Human Rights. We also value economic and social rights, but tragic historical experiences have shown us that, whenever these are placed over and above rights of a personal nature, freedom as a whole suffers. It is dangerous to mix formulas for combating unemployment with fundamental rights. For this reason, we consider that such rights, and indeed fundamental rights, should be dealt with in a separate report. Meanwhile, it would make perfect sense in this report to devote greater attention to the right to life, the rights of the unborn child, the rights of victims and the rights of families which have unaccountably been omitted.</p>

<img align="absmiddle" alt="" src="/doceo/data/img/arrow_summary.gif"/>  <span class="doc_subtitle_level1_bis">Ford </span> <span class="bold">(PSE).</span> – Mr President, I congratulate Mrs Pailler on her report which was drawn up in difficult circumstances. I would like to make four brief comments. I support my colleague Martin Schulz<span class="bold"> </span>
in saying that we have no option but to produce such a report on human rights in the European Union. We spend time every month talking about human rights outside the European Union and if we never look inward at all – never look at the plank in our own eye, compared to what is happening outside – we are justifiably criticized for having a rather Eurocentric view of the world.</p>
<p class="contents">Secondly, let me say that it is clear that when the Amsterdam Treaty is ratified, the Committee on Civil Liberties and Internal Affairs is going to have a much more important role. We will be able to speak with authority providing we can reach a degree of consensus. I welcome the comment by Mrs d'Ancona, the chairman of the committee, that in future we should try to reach a degree of consensus in this report and not have the two political <span class="italic">blocs</span>
 battling against each other. It seems to me that we considerably weaken the points we make.</p>
<p class="contents">Thirdly, I would like the report in future to be more positive. There are good things happening in the world. For example the town of Badolato in Italy has welcomed a large number of Kurdish refugees with enthusiasm. The mayor of that town will be giving a press conference at 3 o'clock this afternoon. There are a number of other similar kinds of actions we could welcome in the report, rather than the slightly negative approach.</p>
<p class="contents">There are omissions. I would like to have seen a reference to the European Observatory to monitor racism, xenophobia and antisemitism which will be commenting implicitly on human rights in the European Union from outside. However, I have to say that I was amazed by the hypocrisy of some of our colleagues – Mr Le Gallou actually quoted Voltaire – when members of his party in Orange, Vitrolles, Marignane and Toulon are going through the libraries stripping out the books and the periodicals they disagree with.</p>
<p class="contents">Finally, I would like to comment on cheque‐book eugenics being practised in these towns where people are being paid to have white children. It seems to me that is also a violation of human rights.</p>

 Mr President, I have asked to speak again because I feel that the personal attacks on Mrs Pailler need to be denounced. Some people may take issue with Aline Pailler's opinions, but to call her report the product of a criminal ideology, as the representative of the National Front has done, is outrageous, and should have been repudiated by the President.</p>
<p class="contents"><span class="italic"><span class="italic">(Applause)</span> </span></p>
<p class="contents">If anyone in this House has the right to attack Mrs Pailler in this way, it is certainly not this man, who is a fanatical supporter of a certain Mr Le Pen, who describes Auschwitz as a footnote in history – and has unfortunately gone unpunished for this to date – and it is certainly not someone who represents a party at whose conferences young Moroccans occasionally just fall into the water by accident. I have had just about enough of the extreme right in this Parliament, and of the brazen way they have started in recent months to attack democratically minded Members of this Parliament, and I call upon the President to intervene firmly in such cases in future!</p>

<img align="absmiddle" alt="" src="/doceo/data/img/arrow_summary.gif"/>  <span class="doc_subtitle_level1_bis">Van den  Broek, </span> <span class="italic">Member of the Commission.</span><span class="bold"><span class="underline"> </span></span><span class="italic">‐ (NL)</span> Mr President, let me start by thanking Mrs Pailler for her report, and by joining those who have spoken appreciatively about this effort, but especially about the fact that this year, too, a report is being issued on the human rights situation in the Union. This does not mean, and this became crystal clear during the debate, that everything which was taken as a position in the report, was even shared by a majority in this Parliament. In that sense, what was said by various Members appeals greatly to me, namely the desirability of reaching a greater consensus in this House, both on the definition of human rights, and on the subjects which are discussed in this report.</p>
<p class="contents">Mr President, the Commission is not here to teach Parliament what human rights are, what they ought to be and to what degree they are observed or not. You know that the European Commission, like Parliament in fact, has very little to say on the human rights situation within the Union. But what does appeal to the Commission as well is the position that it is no good exchanging views here during every part‐session about violations of human rights in the world – and this part‐session will be no exception to this fitting custom –, whilst turning a blind eye to the shortcomings which are happening in the sphere of human rights within the Union. But I would like to add that we can count ourselves lucky that all our Member States, as members of this large Council of Europe, are bound by the European Convention on Human Rights. There is no treaty in the world with so many enforcement instruments for human rights violations as the European Convention on Human Rights.</p>
<p class="contents">In other words, if we have a debate here together, if we exchange views on these kinds of shortcomings, then we have at least the safety valve of the Council of Europe which should be a symbol of democracy and of the protection of fundamental rights and freedoms within Europe.</p>
<p class="contents">Mr President, I repeat, this does not mean that the responsibility of this House or of the European Commission, let alone the Council and its President‐in‐Office, is no longer under discussion. No, Mr President, we also feel called on to contribute something to these kind of debates towards further awareness‐raising about human rights, also within the Union. The Union is founded on the principles of freedom, democracy and respect for human rights, and, as you will remember, in 1993 the European Council laid down for the first time the provision for stable institutions to guarantee the democracy, rule of law, human rights and respect for and protection of minorities, as a condition for entry to the European Union. It goes without saying that conditions laid down in this area for new entrants, must also be observed fully by the existing Member States.</p>
<p class="contents">Like the previous report, the 1996 report brings up the problems the citizens in the Union, and all those who have settled there, are confronted with. But the report also formulates a number of requests which are primarily aimed at the Member States. Of course, the justification for this can be found in the fact that the Treaties do not assign general powers to the Union as such in order to guarantee observance. The Community for its part is merely authorized to implement Community regulations which are founded on observance of these rights. In the report a few requests are directed at the Commission. I will return to these shortly.</p>
<p class="contents">I would also like to underline what has been said about the universality and indivisibility of human rights: political and civil rights on the one hand, and socio‐economic and cultural rights on the other. This principle constitutes in my view the cornerstone of the efforts of the Union on behalf of the observance of human rights. I can therefore appreciate that Parliament has committed itself to dealing with these rights in their entirety when judging the efforts made by the Member States on behalf of the observance of these rights.</p>
<p class="contents">As far the Commission"s specific requests are concerned, Mr President, with regard to asylum policy I can inform you that we totally agree that asylum seekers who are deported to safe third countries must have access to fair, efficient and transparent asylum procedures. This will almost certainly be one of the conditions included in the Commission"s coming proposal for an asylum treaty. We are still investigating, however, whether separate regulations for asylum seekers will be required for this, in other words, without use of the usual re‐admission agreements. We think it is likely, and this is also the opinion of the High Commission for Refugees, that we will conclude that separate regulations will indeed be required.</p>
<p class="contents">The systematic consideration of the consequences of Community policy for cultural aspects is pursuant to Article 128, Clause 4 of the Maastricht Treaty which laid this down as an obligation. On account of this, in April 1996, the Commission approved a report on the observance of cultural aspects during Community actions. We are working on a new report at the moment.</p>
<p class="contents">Furthermore, the improvement of access for journalists and the public to data from national and Community institutions is also a permanent concern for the Commission. With this objective in my mind, information channels close to the citizen are given specific and clear information. In addition, a special unit has been given the task of improving access to information from the Community"s institutions.</p>
<p class="contents">Mr President, I would like to conclude by pointing out that the Union"s Member States must set the example as regards observance of human rights, as the Union regularly declares that this observance constitutes an essential factor in international relations. It forms the basis for European cooperation and relations with third countries. The Union strives for universal observance of these human rights, and it has proved this clearly by including in agreements with third countries systematic references to democratic principles and human rights, which form an essential part, as described, of these agreements. Moreover, the agreements contain a suspension clause for cases where there is a case of serious violations, and this theme is systematically raised as an essential part of the political dialogue with third countries. The Union will not be able to consolidate its action as regards compliance with the international agreements entered into by third countries in this area, unless a calm debate can be held on shortcomings, including those within our Union.</p>

 I have a point of information, Mr President. In his speech, Mr Nassauer referred to part of my own speech. In case I did not express myself properly, I should like to correct that. I was talking about the psychological pressure exerted, not by the institutions of the European Union, but by the authorities of the Member States of the European Union, who sometimes exert psychological pressure to the point of terrorizing people. I stand by this statement, as after 11 years as the mayor of a German town, I know exactly what I am talking about. I have in mind, for example, forced deportation from Germany of people who have lived in my country for 17 years, have been educated there and are now being deported because their parents at some point failed to make a proper application for asylum. I regard the way we treat people like this as psychologically intolerable.</p>
<p class="contents">As a former Minister of the Interior for the <span class="italic">Länder</span>
 of Hessen, Mr Nassauer knows this is true. If he now tries to pretend that he does not, this should be firmly repudiated. In any case, the fact that as coordinator of the second largest group he is not even here for the end of this debate shows how seriously he takes this subject.</p>

 Mr President, Mr Schulz is wrong in his personal challenge on me but then, he challenges a lot of people!</p>
<p class="contents">In my speech, I made no personal attack against Mrs Pailler. I questioned the ideology which Mrs Pailler and the party which elected her claim to represent, a party which honours the name of the criminal Lenin in its municipal councils. It was therefore a political comment.</p>
<p class="contents">The approach of Mr Schulz and certain extremists opposite me is very clear: it is to aim to stifle the freedom of expression of Members who do not think like themselves. Well, let me tell them that political freedom is the freedom to let those talk who do not think like yourself!</p>
<p class="contents">One last point, Mr Schulz. You spoke of censure in the libraries in Toulon, Orange, and Marignane. This is not true! No books have been withdrawn from these libraries. It is simply the case that these libraries have acquired books which are banned in town libraries under the control of the socialist and communist parties. We have thus brought further freedom!</p>

 Mr President, Commissioner, ladies and gentlemen, this own‐initiative report on the implementation of Structural Fund appropriations aims to highlight the reasons for the problems in ensuring that EU Structural Fund appropriations are routed from Brussels to the final recipients at local level, to draw conclusions from this examination and to suggest solutions for the new programme planning period from 2000 to 2006. Whereas the 1989 to 1993 programme planning period for EU structural projects was generally successful, the new 1994 to 1999 planning period got off to a hesitant start. One of the reasons for this was a string of uncompleted projets from the previous period; ECU 13 billion still remained to be paid out. There were also more high‐profile delays in adopting new legislative provisions in Brussels. These delays led in turn to a lack of confidence on the part of national, regional and local authorities and thus to a slowdown in the outflow of funds to potential final recipients.</p>
<p class="contents">The actual application process involving regional authorities and the project leaders only got properly under way months later. Some of the applications were of very poor quality because they were rushed. In many cases, this led to further negotiations which resulted in a further delay in the outflow of funds.</p>
<p class="contents">The situation has returned to normal since 1996. Appropriations are essentially being spent by the specified deadline. However, the Parliament wishes, by means of this report, to warn both the Commission and the Council of the risk of another poor start for the forthcoming planning period. We do not want a repeat of the situation at the end of 1996, when a total of ECU 26.7 billion had accumulated in the form of amounts still to be paid, from the previous and the current programme planning period.</p>
<p class="contents">The report lists a series of further causes for non‐implementation. For example, a significant proportion is due to Community initiatives which only took effect after a considerable delay because of administrative and resource problems at European level.</p>
<p class="contents">With reference to the current revision of the Structural Funds and preparations for the new programme planning period, I have reached the following conclusions in my report.</p>
<p class="contents">Point 1: decentralized decision making on regional policy tends to result in a superior level of planning and to improved utilization rates.</p>
<p class="contents">Point 2: it is essential, to guarantee successful implementation of programmes, to secure cofinancing, and regional financial autonomy is conducive to success here.</p>
<p class="contents">Point 3: an improvement is needed in consistency between national and European policies, with better coordination of objectives, strategies and measures between the various levels – European, national and regional.</p>
<p class="contents">Point 4: the time factor, as I have indicated, is particularly important. Regulations must be published at the beginning of 1998 and must be adopted quickly so that local, regional and national authorities have sufficient time to draw up programmes, avoiding a repeat of 1994. At present we are making good progress with preparations.</p>
<p class="contents">Point 5: reductions in appropriations by the Council for budgetary reasons should be rejected, as this is not the answer to the nonimplementation of appropriations.</p>
<p class="contents">Point 6: rebudgetization must still be allowed, and I believe that the tentative proposals in Agenda 2000 in this respect should not be pursued any further.</p>
<p class="contents">Point 7: it would be greatly advantageous if we could introduce the principle of a leading role for a single fund, Commission Directorate‐General and ministry for each Member State having responsibility and being in charge of implementation.</p>
<p class="contents">I would like to conclude by thanking my colleagues from the Committee on Regional Policy for their constructive cooperation. I would also like to thank those colleagues who made many suggestions for improvements, and I would also like to thank the committees asked for opinions for the contribution they made to improving the report.</p>

I would like to add a few aspects from the European Social Fund and on behalf of the Committee on Employment and Social Affairs.</p>
<p class="contents">It appeared that at the end of 1995, ECU 2 billion had yet to be allocated from the Structural Funds, of which three quarters had been allocated to the European Social Fund. An investigation, meanwhile, has shown that it primarily concerned Community initiatives, chiefly in four Member States which had a backlog in implementation, namely Spain, Italy, France and Germany.</p>
<p class="contents">At the end of 1996, it transpired that the initial under‐spending had been reduced, and that the European Social Fund was able to carry through a full expenditure of the available budget resources, but that the Community initiatives and the four countries mentioned earlier plus the United Kingdom continued to cause trouble. Six months ago more than 72 % of the payments for 1997 appeared utilized. This will stand to contradict the notion that there is a chronic implementation problem for the European Social Fund.</p>
<p class="contents">It should therefore be considered, Madam Commissioner, whether a transitional year should be included in order to provide a solution for these significant surpluses. So, on this issue of policy, the double question arises with regard to the spending degree of the European Social Fund: how can we stop the accumulation of non‐utilized resources in 1999, and how can we try to avoid this happening again?</p>
<p class="contents">Then we come to questions about efficiency and effectiveness, questions concerning objectives and area descriptions which should not be too tightly linked, and the implementation of the principles of additionality and cofinancing as far as the Member States and the regions are concerned.</p>

It shows that the problem of under‐utilization which caused so much concern a couple of years ago has receded and is not so serious now. The Commissioner and the Commission should be congratulated on achieving a major increase, a doubling of the Structural Funds, without any significant increase in the cost of administration, and a lot of lessons have been learned about how to proceed with the next phase.</p>
<p class="contents">In the fisheries sector the main concern was the deficiency of the resources rather than the take‐up rate. In 1994‐5 utilization was very satisfactory, above‐average. Although there was a slowing down in 1996, we do not expect there to be any problem with under‐utilization in the main part of the fisheries guidance programme for the period of the programme. Problems exist however with the Pesca programme which is criticized mainly because it is too small to achieve the wide‐ranging objectives that were set for it; half of it is designed for the Objective 1 regions. It was intended to diversify economic activity in regions depending heavily on fishing. That objective could easily be achieved within the mainstream of our regional policy for peripheral regions. Alternatively, you could push the money back into the main part of the fisheries programme, develop more aquaculture and achieve better prices for fish through better marketing.</p>
<p class="contents">Post−2000 we would like to see one single global measure in the fisheries sector with a higher percentage than the 1.5 % we have at present. All the fisheries regions are peripheral and disadvantaged and the Community is only 50 % self‐sufficient in fisheries products, so there is plenty of scope for education and training and for the development of aquaculture.</p>

<img align="absmiddle" alt="" src="/doceo/data/img/arrow_summary.gif"/>  <span class="doc_subtitle_level1_bis">McCarthy </span> <span class="bold">(PSE).</span> – Mr President, Commissioner and Members of the House, I welcome today's debate on the Berend Report, the own‐initiative report, which in fact followed my group's request that we do more work on this area and commission the research report on the non‐utilization of funds.</p>
<p class="contents">Any one of us here today can give chapter and verse of situations in their own area or region where the Structural Funds are not getting through to the final beneficiaries, thereby causing serious cashflow problems and even threatening project viability.</p>
<p class="contents">Mr Berend raises several key issues which require solutions for future reform of the funds. In relation to the perennial problem of match funding, we require an innovative and flexible approach by all partners and we may need more support for public‐private partnerships, for example in the form of European Investment Bank loans and EIF loans. If it is possible to build the Paris Hilton on soft loans, it surely must be possible to support more public infrastructure and Community business development within the same funds.</p>
<p class="contents">Commissioner, I want to take the opportunity to make a few comments on your proposal for an efficiency reserve because today is the time to do that, particularly with the ideas on efficiency and yesterday's report in the Financial Times on the EU's intention to reward the frugal. We eagerly await your detailed proposals and the criteria for this new reserve. However, to date we have had no discussion in committee on the precise details of how this will work and therefore it is no surprise that in our report we do not give unconditional approval to such a reserve. I would like to sound a few notes of caution in this area.</p>
<p class="contents">It is difficult to conceive of how the EU can set up objective criteria. It will also be difficult to have the EU as a final arbitrator of efficiency, and efficiency of criteria must of course reflect the operation and objectives of regional and local actors. It may be therefore better to take Mr Berend's view that decentralization is the agenda and let the regions and the Member States together run such an efficiency reserve. We are also concerned of course that efficiency may be linked to speedy implementation which rewards the big spenders without taking into consideration quality and innovation.</p>
<p class="contents">Finally, let me just say that we cannot give carte blanche to Mr Berend's paragraph 32 in which he intends to reallocate all unspent resources to Member States with the capacity to absorb resources without any clear criteria on this issue as well. We have to be careful not to penalize the local and regional partners who are the victims of poor administrative structures and I am surprised in fact that Mr Berend, representing a Member State which is a poor spender, is quite happy to give away money to Spain and Greece if his own Member State cannot spend those funds.</p>

 Mr President, Commissioner, ladies and gentlemen, for the citizens of the European Union, and especially for those less well off, the Structural Funds are the most visible indication that the Union takes the idea of solidarity seriously, and that the Union is more than an economic and capital‐focused organization.</p>
<p class="contents">In this light, it is particularly important that Structural Fund appropriations are implemented where they are needed. In order to achieve this, and the Berend report does an excellent job of demonstrating this, Structural Fund appropriations need to be well planned, appropriately cofinanced and then implemented in good time. In this respect, things have been in a sorry state. Overcomplicated rules and structures and excessively short deadlines meant that implementation was particularly unsatisfactory in 1994 and 1995. However, the situation was significantly better in 1996, and we can only hope that this will continue in the remaining years.</p>
<p class="contents">The situation has been somewhat different for the three new Member States than for the other twelve. Our planning periods have been even shorter, and in our countries the time allowed for implementation has been even tighter, comparatively speaking. Nevertheless, the three new Member States have planned their Structural Fund appropriations well and spent them promptly. I see this as confirmation of a point I made a little while ago in my report on structural policy in the new Member States, which is that there are also problems in the relatively affluent Member States that justify the use of Structural Funds money.</p>
<p class="contents">In this context I would like to refer to something else germane to the present debate. Member States bordering the CEECs are definitely among the winners from the European unification and enlargement process. But there are also problems in the regions bordering the CEECs, and there are those who stand to lose as well, there is therefore a role for Community and national structural policies in helping to solve these problems.</p>

<img align="absmiddle" alt="" src="/doceo/data/img/arrow_summary.gif"/>  <span class="doc_subtitle_level1_bis">Collins, Gerard </span> <span class="bold">(UPE).</span> – Mr President, I consider the Berend report to be a realistic and objective analysis of the reasons for the under‐utilization of Structural Funds. Mr Berend says the Structural Funds are one of the most important contributions to the visibility of the European Union and to a close relation with its citizens. I agree with that.</p>
<p class="contents">That said, however, I have the gravest doubts that those same citizens understand the political and administrative niceties which were used to explain, and in many cases justify, the under‐utilization of available Community funds.</p>
<p class="contents">Solving the problem of unacceptably high levels of unemployment in the Union is a major priority for all our Member States. The rapporteur is right to highlight the fact that the Structural Fund interventions contribute to job creation, and yet there is underutilization of available Structural Funds.</p>
<p class="contents">The Funds serve to strengthen economic and social cohesion; they serve to encourage ‚economic activity in the most vulnerable rural and less‐favoured regions’ and, not least, to reduce ‚disparities between the levels of development of the various regions’. And still there is under‐utilization of available Structural Funds. The Council of Ministers consistently uses this argument to justify reductions in appropriations, and will continue to do so unless we get our act together.</p>
<p class="contents">There are those who would like to see unused funds repaid to their national exchequers: this is not acceptable now or in the future. In this context I particularly support paragraph 32 of the Berend report where he suggests that unspent money should be reallocated to those Member States which show a capacity to absorb EU resources.</p>
<p class="contents">The Commissioner will not be surprised to hear that Ireland is a case in point. My country has a remarkable record in the uptake of unallocated Structural Funds. However, the work is still far from done in Ireland: there will be a continued need for Structural Funds for years to come to consolidate what has been achieved and to finish what still remains to be done.</p>

 Mr President, Madam Commissioner, I should first like to congratulate Mr Berend on having produced a good and timely report. It deals not so much with how the Structural Funds have been managed during the last six years, as with an analysis of how that management can be improved in the next seven years.</p>
<p class="contents">In that sense I think it is important to stress the need for decentralization in Structural Fund administration, paying attention to the principle of subsidiarity and the important role which regional and local authorities should play. So I think it would be a positive move to reward efficient management of the Funds, and I think it is a good idea to propose a special reserve for those areas where the Funds are well managed, and to talk of administrative authorities which allow for maximum efficiency in their administration.</p>

 Mr President, ladies and gentlemen, Commissioner, this report fails to mention one of the essential reasons why the implementation of Structural Fund appropriations is sometimes unsatisfactory.</p>
<p class="contents">The budget cuts intended to obtain the results required to achieve nominal convergence in order to join the third phase of EMU has meant that some Member States are not fulfilling pledges corresponding to Community cofinancing. This has also led to delays in the implementation of structural activities which cannot and should not prompt the erroneous conclusion that there are no projects, no situations of need or, still less, that acute infrastructure disparities no longer exist.</p>
<p class="contents">The implementation of Structural Funds would be improved by reformulating macro‐economic guidelines, and not by placing inadmissible obstacles in the way of the automatic rebudgetization of allocations, or of the indicative allocation of Structural Fund appropriations by Member States.</p>

 Mr President, a partnership only works if everyone sticks to the agreements. This applies even more to agreements between Member States and the Union, when it comes to overcoming disparities between the countries of the European Union. We therefore agree with the rapporteur that quality should be the deciding factor. We cannot tolerate a situation in which the Council reacts to difficulties in utilizing Structural Fund appropriations in Member States by reducing these appropriations in the budget, thus preventing a uniform outflow of Structural Funds money. At the end of the programming period the Member States are faced with the task of utilizing unspent appropriations in a very short time frame. It is therefore important that in the new period local and regional partnerships, which are vital for successful implementation, should participate in good time. We must give them a chance to participate at an early stage, and given the delay which is currently looming in the new programming period, we need an interim solution. We need this in order to sort out participation rights now, because planning is already under way in the relevant offices and the result could well be that the social partners and the regional and local authorities, may again be confronted with a <span class="italic">fait accompli</span>
.</p>
<p class="contents">I have one last, but important point: we need to have a monitoring committee in order to achieve the necessary flexibility. Its powers certainly need to be increased if we are to avoid a similar delay in the next programming period.</p>

<p class="contents">Structural Funds are often intended to address an immediate problem, such as the demise of the steel industry. However, in this case, it is the demise of a people we are talking about: half of the population of the Highlands and Islands was lost this century. The Objective 1 status is trying to address this problem and, for the first time, we have just begun to retain our young people in the area.</p>
<p class="contents">Mr Berend speaks of a smooth transition. As regards under‐utilization, I should like to emphasize that the Highlands and Islands have an excellent record in using up the money it has been given. The Commission will verify that. I would like to associate myself with the new Secretary of State for Scotland, Donald Dewar, who is fighting to retain Objective 1 status so that there will be the smooth transition that Mr Berend speaks of.</p>

 Mr President, the structural causes preventing a rational and satisfactory use of the funds include the far more harmful administrative and procedural causes. These depend on the quality of the administrations and their coordination as well as the quality of the programmes and their execution.</p>
<p class="contents">The allocation of duties and the subdivision of the three administrative levels make greater coordination necessary. The multiple nature of the initiatives taken, the complexity of the matter, the lack of specific information and the inflexibility of the Community regulations make a full awareness and satisfactory balancing of the Structural Funds by public and private persons extremely difficult.</p>
<p class="contents">The principle of partnership should therefore be fully reinforced to facilitate new solutions and increase cooperation and coordination at all levels. Its direct consequence will be an increased transparency of the procedures and a better adaptation of the measures taken in respect of particular objectives, with the greater involvement of local and regional participants.</p>
<p class="contents">Finally, I wish to say that I am totally against any reduction in allocations of payment to structural policies by the Council of Ministers. The problem of use of the Funds would not be resolved and this Council attitude would clearly be contradictory to the decisions taken in Edinburgh and would bring the actual economic and social cohesion policy into discussion.</p>

 Mr President, Madam Commissioner, ladies and gentlemen, we have 18 million unemployed in the European Union, and yet we recently witnessed the spectacle of over DM 1 billion of Structural Fund appropriations available for financing appropriate counter‐measures being repaid to national exchequers in order to solve budget problems in those countries, including countries which are normally regarded as the strongest in the Union.</p>
<p class="contents">For this reason alone, there are grounds for examining why these appropriations were not properly implemented. Why can we not move more quickly? What is to be done about this? Mr Berend has submitted a very good report with proposals for tackling these problems. What can we do? First, and this is one of the key points, we must make sure that a decision on future Structural Funds is taken as quickly as possible – we have to learn from our past mistakes here. So we must ensure that the next rounds of deliberations on Structural Funds reaches a swifter conclusion. However, I am a realist. I know how difficult that will be, but I think that rapid progress is necessary here. We as a Parliament can also give notice that we expect to take part in this process, at least in accordance with the rights accorded to us under the Amsterdam Treaty, if not more so. I therefore call upon all concerned to allow us to participate in the decision‐making process.</p>
<p class="contents">Second, we need to take a close look at the administrative and budget structures and improve them. We have seen that some aspects are in a sorry state. This debate about Structural Funds cannot just be limited to how much money is spent and where. If we are to be taken seriously we also need to discuss how a more appropriate distribution can be achieved.</p>
<p class="contents">Third, we need to discuss how we in the regions can reinforce partnerships and how we can strengthen the monitoring committees, so that money is really allocated where it is needed and actually used. I am sure that an effective judgement on this is better made at local rather than European level, and for that reason we need to enhance the role of the monitoring committees by putting them on an equal footing with the economic and social partners and with regional and local partners.</p>
<p class="contents">My fourth point is that we must of course create a system of incentives, be it in the form of a reserve, as suggested by the Commission, or in the form of a mid‐term review. We must ensure that appropriations are implemented and that anyone who leaves them unspent runs the risk of a penalty, for example by receiving less money. All this needs to be discussed and seriously considered. I consider this to be a vital issue regarding the further development of the Structural Funds.</p>

 Mr President, Madam Commissioner, ladies and gentlemen, I want to begin my speech by congratulating the rapporteur on the quality of his report, given the difficulty of precisely analysing the shortcomings in the implementation of the Structural Funds. This difficulty arises from the problems being so diverse – the fact that they affect different Member States, different regions, different funds, different objectives and different systems of administration. This makes the problems difficult to study, and also makes it hard to establish general guidelines.</p>
<p class="contents">Nevertheless, it has to be said that it is a very good report, which emphasizes – among other things – that during the 1989‐1993 programming period the payment appropriations reached 84 % in the Community support frameworks and only 70 % in Community initiatives. However, during the current period, after a disappointing start (1994‐1995) there has been a notable improvement in 1996, although it varies according to the instrument and the objective.</p>
<p class="contents">It is more satisfactory in the ERDF and EAGGF‐Guidance than in other funds – the Community initiatives show an implementation of only 90 % – but I want to stress that it is precisely Objective 1 which shows a more positive implementation compared with the other objectives. The experience we have gained should help to improve the current system in the face of the immediate challenge of reform. So the Berend report is a timely and valuable contribution, and we stress the need to establish a precise timetable in sufficient time, as soon as the regulations have been published, so that in 1999 the various administrations can adapt to the new programming. The need for greater concentration, simplification, decentralization, and cooperation with the social partners and the local and regional authorities means that correct programming will take longer, and that must be taken into account. Continuous assessment and effective control with incentives – as proposed – for those Member States which implement their appropriations optimally will also be positive measures which must be taken into account.</p>
<p class="contents">In conclusion then, I want to say that a lot of important work remains to be done, but the Berend report has come at a very good time and the rapporteur must be congratulated on that.</p>

 Mr President, in the present review of Structural Funds it is vital to correct the errors which have been responsible for ineffective and delayed utilization of appropriations, as we simply cannot afford to allow structural policy to become ineffectual. The challenges to EU regional and structural policy are ever growing.</p>
<p class="contents">The biggest problems are connected with fragmented management, bureaucracy and actually getting started on the various phases of a programme. Getting started depends on local partners being involved right from the planning stage. The principle of partnership really must be driven home and internal coordination in administration must be made better. We can no longer waste time and energy with complicated bureaucracy, where the benefits are eventually meagre and mainly involve training and consultancy agencies.</p>
<p class="contents">In rural regions which are being deserted, in Finland and elsewhere, the situation is especially critical. Unless the decline in population in such areas is checked it will soon be too late. The Commission is right on this point. We must give more weight to the importance of independent development for the regions.</p>

 Mr President, the under‐utilization of Structural Fund appropriations is a very serious problem, in view of the fact that difficulties in implementing the appropriations lead the social partners to seek expensive solutions based on intermediate funding, which affects the general effectiveness of the projects. Obviously this situation cannot continue but must change, and we agree with Mr Berend there. However, we think some of the measures he proposes in order to resolve this difficulty are counter‐productive: specifically, the measure described in paragraph 32 seems to us to be counter‐productive – the reallocation of resources in favour of those Member States who have shown an ability to absorb the EU resources which have been assigned to them – because in fact that means setting up a new system based on penalties.</p>
<p class="contents">I think we need to approach the question in a more flexible manner. Otherwise, economic and social cohesion, which we are trying to benefit, could suffer more harm than good.</p>

<img align="absmiddle" alt="" src="/doceo/data/img/arrow_summary.gif"/>  <span class="doc_subtitle_level1_bis">Howitt </span> <span class="bold">(PSE).</span> – Mr President, the public hearing we held on behalf of the Committee on Regional Policy last year for the east and south‐east of England underlines the main findings of Mr Berend's report. Essex, Bedfordshire and Hertfordshire councils said current management systems actually deter potential project bidders. A very good project proposal on new towns from SouthEast Economic Development Strategy remained unanswered for over a year. The East Anglian authorities involved in the 5b rural development programme talk of a flurry of complex queries always raised at the eleventh hour.</p>
<p class="contents">The Association of Eastern Colleges points out that the annuality of European social funding is a bureaucratic nightmare, whilst cooperative businesses in the eastern region say that in each and every one of the last nine years there has been delay and underspend.</p>
<p class="contents">Member States and local partners must take their share of responsibility, but today we must call on the Commission to end the vicious cycle of delay and underspend and to publish evaluation criteria in advance and then stick to them, which has been a particular problem in our 5b programme. It must also ensure assistance to claim the funds goes to the voluntary organizations and do everything possible to break the mould and to ensure that the new programming period from 1999 starts on time.</p>

 Mr President, I think Parliament's initiative to look at the issue of how the Structural Funds' resources are used was a very good initiative, and Mr Berend's work on that important subject has been very good and worthy, I believe, of sincere congratulations.</p>
<p class="contents">From the work done by Mr Berend and all those whose amendments have helped this report, what emerges as certain is that, in general, with the passage of time, the problems have been confined to the utilization of resources but that they still exist. The problems associated with the Social Fund and Community initiatives are characteristic, and so is the fact that ECU 3.4 billion remain unused, a figure which speaks for itself.</p>
<p class="contents">The reasons, I think, have been given: delays in the submission of the rules at the start of the programming phase by the Commission, delays on the part of the Member States in submitting proposals, the large number of programmes, etc. We must therefore learn from our experience so far for the future, Mr President, and I think we ought to move in two basic directions: concentration and simplification, in other words, on the one hand, fewer programmes, fewer Community initiatives, unification of the procedures and mechanisms of the Funds so that we can achieve better results, and on the other hand, simplification of the procedures, although without going as far as an abdication by the Commission of its responsibilities, allowing everyone to do what they want without any checks and balances.</p>
<p class="contents">Besides what I have said, I want to mention the idea of the reserve, which is an idea raised by the Commission in Agenda 2000. It is an idea which we, in principle, believe should not be rejected because it could lead to greater competition between interested agencies to absorb the resources. The Commission, however, must make it more specific so that it stops being a carte‐blanche authorization as it is at present. Parliament will never agree to a carte‐blanche authorization. We want more details about this idea from the Commission.</p>

 Mr President, I think we have to accept that there is something rotten in the Community's regional policy so far as the financial resources set aside for it are concerned. On the one hand, there are many very acute problems in many regions, and on the other hand, there is an unused and unabsorbed surplus of around ECU 25‐26 billion. That is where the anomaly, where what is rotten lies. This is pointed out in the report, especially in Mr Berend's explanatory statement, as well as in the reports by the Committee on Agriculture and the Committee on Budgets. Indeed, these last two add the special point that nowhere is there any mention in this policy of a proposal on the future of the agricultural world in the context of Agenda 2000, while the Committee on Budgets notes that little interest has been shown in frontier regions. I want to add that there is also little interest, amounting to disregard of the island regions. In that respect, indeed, there is a shocking exclusion, namely that the Aegean islands are excluded from the operational programmes in relation to transport, energy, communications, etc. And finally, Mr President, and I will conclude with this, the distribution is unequal. The regional policy seems to have discovered that Germany has become poorer than Greece and Portugal, and is for that reason getting a 45 % increase from the funds, while those two poorer countries are to suffer cuts of 17 % and 20 % respectively. That is unacceptable and unless it is put right you should expect no progress towards Community cohesion.</p>

 Mr President, Madam Commissioner, ladies and gentlemen, a Europe with huge discrepancies between its various regions in terms of their level of prosperity can be neither credible nor viable. For that reason, the policy of economic and social cohesion is one of the Union's most vital essentials. The Community resources that support the structural activities have produced particularly encouraging results in the Union's less developed regions, improving competitiveness, development and employment in those areas.</p>
<p class="contents">Today, there is certainly a need for the Structural Funds to become still better and more effective. Yet, to focus attention and effort on absorption and not efficacy is, in my view, a mistaken approach. It is known that in the past there have been parts of the Union which absorbed 100 % of what was available, but without at the same time showing any increase of their per‐capita GDP. So the issue is how to make use of the Structural Funds' resources in the surest and most effective way. Every ECU provided must yield a positive result in the areas of development, competitiveness and employment. I think that Greece today provides a very good example of the honest and effective utilization of Structural Fund resources.</p>
<p class="contents">We would, of course, like to express very serious reservations about the Commission's intention to place no restrictions on the management of 10 % of the Structural Fund resources for the next planning period.</p>

 Mr President, the rapporteur has quite rightly targeted his main criticisms at the considerable delays during the programme's start‐up. I would like to support him in this. There are a number of serious reasons why we should not tolerate similar delays in the forthcoming 1999‐2000 period.</p>
<p class="contents">First, the fight against growing unemployment in our Member States requires rapid and complete implementation of all European Structural Fund appropriations. Second, this will equip us to deal better with the substantial pressure to adjust that will be experienced both by individual sectors and also by whole regions. Third, the envisaged enlargement towards the east of the EU will be a real test of the European instruments designed to assist underdeveloped areas.</p>
<p class="contents">One thing is quite clear: we must heed the voices of our unemployed EU citizens and speed up this whole process, from the most local level all the way up to national and European level.</p>

 Mr President, in many speeches and reports it has been observed that EU regional and structural policy have not been entirely successful. Mr Berend"s report also points to solutions to problems. It is very important, as has here been mentioned, that the Structural Funds review be realized according to schedule. This means that the vital decisions have to be taken by the end of 1998 at the latest.</p>
<p class="contents">The report clearly points out that the greatest problems, linked, as they are, to this phase of the programme, are rooted in the delay in start‐up owing to hesitancy in making decisions. This must not happen again and this should be the clear message to the Council and others.</p>
<p class="contents">However, spending money is not the most important thing. The most important thing is the quality of the programmes, and achieving real, measurable progress through them. This is a particular challenge to those regions and agencies that hope to benefit from future reviews of Structural Funds.</p>

<img align="absmiddle" alt="" src="/doceo/data/img/arrow_summary.gif"/>  <span class="doc_subtitle_level1_bis">Wulf‐Mathies, </span> <span class="italic">Member of the Commission. – (DE)</span>
 Mr President, I would first like to thank the rapporteur, Mr Berend, for his thorough study and his very pertinent report on the implementation of Structural Fund appropriations. The Commission is conscious that the rate of utilization was relatively low in 1994 and 1995, and that there is accordingly a risk that outflow of funds will be concentrated towards the end of the programme planning period.</p>
<p class="contents">This experience gives us good grounds for reorganizing the financial management of the Structural Funds for the programme planning period starting in the year 2000. Nevertheless, I would like to stress that, as you have been able to see for yourselves up to 1996, the level of appropriations still to be executed for Community Support Frameworks, which account for 90 % of total commitments, was considerably lower in 1996 and 1997. However, the implementation rate for Community initiatives is still a cause for concern, even if one of the main reasons is of course that many of these programmes were not adopted until 1995 and 1996.</p>
<p class="contents">The Commission is currently examining the extent to which reprogramming of Community initiatives is both possible and necessary, and has brought this to the attention of the Member States. In December I approached the Member States and asked them for detailed information on the implementation rate of Community initiatives at local level. In view of their capacity to absorb funds, we have to consider possible changes in the content of programmes and the transfer of appropriations within and between programmes.</p>
<p class="contents">In the middle of 1998 the Commission will bring forward proposals for redistribution within Community initiatives throughout the EU, and we will at the same time endeavour to take this Parliament's requests into account. A number of points remain unresolved following the debate on the distribution of the reserve.</p>
<p class="contents">Last but not least, as a consequence of major administrative problems relating to implementation, in Agenda 2000 the Commission proposed a dramatic reduction in Community initiatives by merging them into the mainstream programmes. The present level of commitments still be to implemented is by no means abnormal. It is quite logical that there should be an increase in the level of commitments remaining to be implemented, in view of the rise in commitment appropriations from year to year, while payment appropriations may not precisely match these. Nevertheless, in recent years payments from the respective financial years have also been increasingly used to implement commitments from previous financial years.</p>
<p class="contents">Unspent commitments from the period before 1994, which amounted to ECU 3.26 billion by the end of 1997, relate either to actions where an extension of the implementation period is considered justified and is approved, or to actions which have been suspended for legal reasons and which have not therefore been completed. As extensions of payment periods were only granted up to the end of 1997, we are now simply talking about final settlements rather than commitments which will continue to burden the Community budget because of their due dates. I am referring in particular to paragraph 30, in which you quite rightly request clarification.</p>
<p class="contents">Like Parliament, the Commission is anxious to work towards complete implementation of appropriations right from the beginning of each programme planning period, and to avoid any delays of the kind you have described.</p>
<p class="contents">As regards Parliament's concern about the large amount to be implemented once again under the 1999 budget process, I would like to remind you that the Community institutions, in accordance with the Interinstitutional Agreement and the Framework Regulation on the Structural Funds, is clearly obliged to make the amounts agreed at the Edinburgh European Council available to the Funds. I want to emphasize that here.</p>
<p class="contents">I would also like to stress that an extension of the current programme planning period would contravene both the Framework Regulation on the Structural Funds and the Interinstitutional Agreement. The Commission has therefore stated unambiguously that no overlap between the two programme planning periods will be allowed.</p>
<p class="contents">The Commission will be issuing its legislative reform proposals in March, and it will then be up to Parliament and the Council to consider and adopt these proposals promptly. The Commission will do everything in its power to ensure that the new programmes are implemented promptly as from 2000. The Commission therefore believes that it would be counterproductive, in terms of prompt consideration and adoption of the regulations and programmes, if it were to consider interim solutions at this point.</p>
<p class="contents">The Commission generally shares Parliament's views on the simplification of Structural Fund implementation. Further decentralization and greater participation by local and regional authorities and by the social partners right from the start of the programme planning process is therefore essential in the interests of greater efficiency. The new proposals for regulations provide for a clear allocation of responsibilities between the various parties, an enhancement of the role of the monitoring committees and for reinforced Commission powers as regards checks and sanctions against contraventions of the regulations. In this respect we are in complete agreement, not only with the requests in the report but also with the relevant comments made in this debate.</p>
<p class="contents">The Commission believes that it is necessary to create a performance‐related financial reserve as a means of increasing the efficiency of structural measures, and I thank you for the basic support for this which has been a feature of many comments here. Of course no‐one wants to write a blank cheque before this subject has been carefully examined against objective criteria which we shall be putting forward, and it is obvious that such a reserve cannot be a blank cheque for the Commission, which will have to follow transparent rules. However, I do believe that this is one way of complying with the suggestion that unused Funds should, where appropriate, be transferred to other parties instead of repaying them to national exchequers. I therefore believe that an indepth discussion of this is needed, and I would like to specifically invite the Committee on Regional Policy to participate.</p>
<p class="contents">The new budget structure proposed by Parliament, with implementation shown according to programme planning periods, would lead to a greater number of budget headings, which would in turn complicate administration, just as with Community initiatives now, and would be inconsistent with the aim of simplification.</p>
<p class="contents">To conclude, I should like to remind you that the Commission will issue its proposals on 18 March. We are convinced that these proposals for decentralization and simplification will facilitate efficient implementation of appropriations and the Commission will, as before, fully involve the Parliament in this process from the outset.</p>

 There may be some doubt as to the wording of the English text. We would like to amend “workforce’ to “workers' concern’. If we retain “workforce’, this means that the entire staff of a company will vote on whether an individual employee is to undergo a health examination. If we change it to’worker's concern’ it is the individuals themselves who can decide. So this is merely an amendment to the wording in that language to avoid any doubt.</p>

 Mr President, I would just like to make one comment: this morning, many Members, starting with Mr Nassauer, noted the shortage of resources available for the Falcone programme and some mentioned the consequence of limiting the extent of intervention to the activities of the judicial and repressive authorities. The funds provided are very small – Mr Nassauer is right – but even if the resources are small, I think it important for the European Parliament also to allocate them to schooling, university and civilian society to show that the battle against the Mafia and organized crime is not just a repressive judicial and police phenomenon but is also, and above all, a phenomenon and a process of renewal and cultural awareness.</p>

 Mr President, there is a problem. It stems from the two reports we have before us, the De Luca report and the Wemheuer report. Both reports contain an identical piece of text. There is an amendment to this text for the Wemheuer report, but there is no corresponding amendment for the De Luca report. It is therefore possible that this Parliament could approve one form of words in the one report and in the other report just the opposite. That makes things rather complicated.</p>
<p class="contents">That is why I have suggested that we need a separate vote here, and that has been moved. We need to ensure that the form of words is changed. The problem is that the House is supposed to be voting first on the one report and only after that on the amendment to the other report. It would have made things simpler if it could have been the other way round, then we would have known where we stand. The problem with Mr De Luca's report would not arise then. It would actually be simpler if you could let us vote on the Wemheuer report first. We would then know the outcome and could adapt the De Luca report accordingly.</p>

 Mr President, I have asked to speak on this point. The problem raised by Mr Samland is not a real problem because both reports, mine and Mr Wemheuer"s, ask for a committee of inquiry to be set up. The amendment proposed relates to something entirely different, that is not opposed to a committee of inquiry; it asks for an examination to be made and for the Committee on Budgetary Control to be permanently assigned similar powers to those of the committee of inquiry. There is therefore no conflict.</p>
<p class="contents">That is why I am amazed by the request for separate votes on point 10 of my report. Yesterday, we all agreed in denouncing the Commission"s obstructionist behaviour towards Parliament. But then what should have been the logical consequence, the settingup a committee of inquiry, has not happened. It seems to me that Parliament is being rather hypocritical in assuming certain attitudes towards the Commission and then being inconsistent.</p>
<p class="contents">As I do not object to the committee of inquiry and the new powers for the Committee on Budgetary Control, I do not think it necessary to change the order of the two reports or to make a similar amendment to my report; but rather, I would ask for the request for separate votes on point 10, which is the most descriptive part of the report, to be withdrawn.</p>

This Rule makes it clear that any Member may propose amendments to the Rules but amendments shall be translated, printed, distributed and referred to the committee responsible which examines them and decides whether to submit them to Parliament. That would be the Committee on the Rules of Procedure, the Verification of Credentials and Immunities.</p>

At one point, Mr President, you used the phrase that we had ‚a duty to vote’. I dispute that. We do not have a duty to vote. We have a duty to know what the vote is about. Then it is up to us whether or not we vote. This is interference with a fundamental right and that is a very serious matter. This is not just an administrative matter. It has political ramifications which affect our right to be re‐elected by the citizenry. It should never have happened the way that it has. By the way, there are no exemptions for presidents in the chair in the strange note we received from our groups.</p>
<p class="contents">I would ask that this goes to the Rules committee. Immediately. You saw the feeling in the House. It is not limited to me.

. – I am happy to vote in favour of this report today. The protection of people from risks related to chemicals in the workplace is a vital health and safety issue, given the number of our fellow citizens who work with chemicals every day.</p>
<p class="contents">It is right that the Commission should assess how well EU governments have enforced indicative safety levels for exposure to chemicals at work. We need to see whether mandatory safety levels are needed to ensure that standards are met.</p>
<p class="contents">This report is also right to call for people at work to be given proper information and safety training on the chemicals they use. The best enforcers of safety laws are well‐informed staff whose own safety is at stake as well as that of the general public who live close to companies where potentially dangerous chemicals are used.</p>
<p class="contents">Nothing done at EU level should stop Member States going further if they wish when setting safety levels for the workplace. But our single market needs minimum common safety standards as well as open competition. Safe companies are usually also successful companies.</p>

 Following the dissolution of the Soviet Union, Ukraine and all the other former USSR Republics have seen their industrial and social fabrics destroyed and suffered a rapid increase of their balance of payments deficit, with the result that the peoples of those republics are in dire economic circumstances. The immediate need to reverse that course of events cannot be satisfied by the continual granting of loans which, on the contrary, increases their balance of payments deficit in the long term and reduces their productive potential.</p>
<p class="contents">The granting of such loans, which mitigates the problem in the short term, is done essentially to enable exports from European companies to Ukraine to be paid for. The third consecutive aid package to Ukraine in recent years aims mainly and primarily to foster the export of the European model of development, to further market penetration in that country, and to control political and social developments by virtue of the very conditions imposed for the granting of those loans and the subsequent control of their use.</p>
<p class="contents">It is no matter of chance that this loan is being given – or that the European Union is promising to give it – just a few weeks before the parliamentary elections in Ukraine, with the aim of intervening directly in the country's political life and controlling the economic policy implemented. It is also no coincidence that the loan is being offered at a time when social conflicts are more acute because of the delay of many months in the payment of salaries.</p>
<p class="contents">With the experience our own people have of similar loans, we ought to say: ’beware of Greeks bearing gifts!’</p>
<p class="contents">Finally, the condition and safety of the sarcophagus of the destroyed portion of the Chernobyl nuclear station, and the continuing operation of the rest of it, must not become an excuse both for the European Union to intervene in Ukraine's internal affairs, and for the Ukrainian government and Mafia to milk resources supposedly provided for the protection of the safety and health of the citizens and the country's development; nor must it become an alibi to foster the economic war unleashed by Western nuclear technology companies pleading the excuse of public safety.</p>

 The Danish Social Democrats will be voting for Mrs Mann's report and assistance for Ukraine. The economic situation in Ukraine continues to be very difficult, and we in the EU have an obligation to help Ukraine solve its problems. On the other hand, we would like to emphasize that we are very concerned that Ukraine is not meeting its obligations to abolish the death penalty. Information from Amnesty International shows that there are 264 people awaiting execution in Ukrainian prisons and the courts are still imposing the death penalty. This is definitely unacceptable. We urgently demand that the Ukraine government abolish the death penalty and also take the necessary steps to improve the human rights situation in Ukraine.</p>

The fact that the prices and exchange rates have been released, the government deficit considerably pushed back, inflation reduced and an extensive privatization programme started, is positive. Yet, in her report Mrs Mann rightly expresses doubt about the current economic situation in Ukraine.</p>
<p class="contents">Opinions vary about the progress of the reforms in Ukraine. The IMF was very positive concerning the situation in Ukraine, and therefore resumed granting credit. The EBRD, on the other hand, was much less positive and concluded that the reforms in Ukraine had come to a stop. Doubts concerning the clean‐up of the Ukrainian economy are thus totally justified.</p>
<p class="contents">Switching from a planned economy to a free market economy does not depend solely on economic factors. Above all, sufficient political support is required, and this is what is presently missing in Ukraine. The controversy between President Kuchma, who believes in reform, and the country"s parliament hinders the reform process.</p>
<p class="contents">I feel I should make a comment on the Commission"s proposals. The question must be raised as to whether it is responsible to give aid in the form of loans. Does this not mean that Ukraine might run the risk of greater payment problems in the longer term? We think issuing part of the aid in the form of donations should be considered.</p>
<p class="contents">This does not alter the fact that we were able to agree with the Mann report and with the proposal to grant macro‐financial aid to Ukraine once more, in addition to the support made available by the international financial institutions and bilateral donors. It is hoped that this will give Ukraine a little more scope to continue its reform of the economy in a more dynamic way.</p>

 – I welcome the provisions in the Amsterdam Treaty which give the European Union, as a political entity, real power to fight organized crime and drug trafficking.</p>
<p class="contents">In a European Union, where there is an internal market with a free movement of goods, persons, services and capital, there is a need for increased police and judicial cooperation to combat drug traffickers who can travel easily within a frontier‐free Europe.</p>
<p class="contents">There has been a substantial degree of cooperation on justice and home affairs issues between the Member States of the Union since the Maastricht Treaty of 1992. However, these provisions have rightly been restructured and re‐adapted by the Amsterdam Treaty to take account of the changing nature of international crime.</p>
<p class="contents">The Amsterdam Treaty is taking the fight to the drugs barons on three different fronts: increased police cooperation between the Member States of the EU; increased powers for Europol (the European Police Agency) and increased judicial cooperation between the Member States of the EU.</p>
<p class="contents">While I fully support these hard‐hitting provisions to fight the European drug barons, there are also extensive and important powers within the Amsterdam Treaty given to the European Union for the funding of drug prevention and information programmes relating to the public health dangers of drugs.</p>
<p class="contents">The people of Europe must be persuaded that a vote in favour of the Amsterdam Treaty is a vote to give the European Union the necessary powers to defeat the twin evils of international drug trafficking and organized crime.</p>

 – The Irish Presidency gave a high priority to tackling organized crime. These proposals that we are currently debating are part of the action plan for combating organized crime that originated from the Dublin European Council.</p>
<p class="contents">It is imperative that we provide opportunities for exchanging experiences, particularly in the areas of cooperation, intelligencegathering and training for those responsible for confronting international criminal activity in Member States of the European Union. Unfortunately, although there has been systematic and regular contact between officials and civil servants from different Member States in areas of traditional EU competence such as agriculture, environment, social affairs etc., the same cannot be said for those working in the ministries of justice and internal affairs in the various Member States. This programme will help remedy this situation.</p>
<p class="contents">I also support Mr Orlando's recommendation that representatives of applicant countries should be involved.</p>

 We consider that the main drive of the combat against organized crime should be directed at prevention, and we consider that it is of prime importance to identify its causes in the hothouse created by the economic, social and political situation in our countries, with tens of millions of people unemployed, homeless, hungry, and generally in a wretched social and personal condition.</p>
<p class="contents">A one‐sided approach to the problem, that is, one concerned only with suppression, has not only been proved ineffectual after all these years of implementing it, but also essentially ignores, if not actually encouraging, conspiracies between the police, the judicial, administrative and other authorities, even at the highest levels, and organized crime.</p>
<p class="contents">The proposals put forward in Mr Orlando's report for the Falcone joint action programme are interesting, but they do not alter the substance of the proposal, which, being caged within the more general concept of the Amsterdam decision, is characterized by ineffectuality, bureaucracy, overlapping of responsibilities and activities with other joint actions. It also contains suspect or dangerous provisions which, if adopted as a new legal base, could extend the field of application provided in the Treaties and in international agreements on cooperation and joint action between the law enforcement authorities.</p>
<p class="contents">We are particularly opposed to any direct or indirect attempt to involve private companies and security organizations in the procedures envisaged by the Community's activities and their funding by the European and the Member States, especially attempts to involve them in the unacceptable procedure of electronic filing.</p>
<p class="contents">Appropriate training of the relevant staff to extend, control and suppress economic crime perpetrated via high technology, public competitions, the bribery or intimidation of certain professions and the laundering of dirty money by legitimizing the proceeds of illegal activities, are of course necessary. The exchange of experiences, to achieve the maximum possible efficacy of related national provisions and assessment of their application is also very important.</p>
<p class="contents">Unfortunately, however, those efforts, even when they are not made to mislead public opinion or for demagogic purposes, conflict with the implacable laws of profit for major interests and multinational enterprises, which are the governing factor of the orientation, design and limits of these interventions.</p>

The statements made by the Commission misrepresent the true facts and represent a continuation of the cover‐up and refusal on the part of the Commission to accept that senior officials sought to avoid criminal inquiries by the police into their suspicions of wrong‐doing and maladministration.</p>
<p class="contents">This gives no cause for confidence in the actions that the Commission may take in the future and the record must show that, notwithstanding MEPs' reluctance to see a committee of inquiry, serious doubts remain.</p>

<p class="contents">The police in Belgium deny this. The letter dated <span class="italic">Bruxelles, le 13 décembre</span>
 1994, amounts to no more than an official notice to the national authorities that the Commission was aware of irregularities related to subventions in the field of tourism.</p>
<p class="contents">As both national authorities have made clear to representatives of this House, the letter gave no instructions and made no formal request for action and, as such, was not acted upon.</p>
<p class="contents">The first clear complaint to the police was made by me to the Belgian Assistant King's Prosecutor, Dirk Merckz, in a letter dated February 11 1995.</p>

 Fraud is facilitated by the administrative mechanisms: the abuse of direct subsidies instead of tenders, unclear selection procedure, inadequate training for employees and excessive delegation of decision‐making duties.</p>
<p class="contents">The factors preventing the necessary clarity on acts of corruption are also administrative.</p>
<p class="contents">Like the rapporteurs, we denounce the attitude adopted by the Commission which has not just been late, but has provided a series of incomplete pieces of information tending to limit the extent of fraud involving real corruption within the Commission"s services.</p>
<p class="contents">Unfortunately, this falls into a culture of the public and administrative office that seeks to avoid criticism in favour of an image which, as events have ultimately shown, has been doubly damaged.</p>
<p class="contents">Public opinion is thus distancing itself even further from the institutions.</p>
<p class="contents">We therefore believe it necessary for the European Parliament, as a democratic, representative body, to actually have new powers of democratic control (we are thinking, for example, of giving the Committee on Budgetary Control powers of information and investigation similar to those held by the committees of inquiry) that would serve to restore within the Commission, which is now used to a bureaucratic culture with no transparency, the principle of responsibility that will serve to give it actual visibility and authority.</p>

 Mr President, the main infringement of human rights in Europe today is the infringement of the liberties of those who do not accept the dominant ideology, whether it be economic, cultural or media.</p>
<p class="contents">The main infringement of human rights is therefore the dictatorship of the “politically correct’, which limits the political freedom of those who want to defend their national identity. In France, Belgium, the Netherlands, Austria and Germany in particular, infringements of the political rights of nationals can be observed in the form of judicial proceedings for expressing an opinion contrary to the ruling party, political or politico‐judicial manipulation, the prohibition of public meetings, the violent attacks on party offices, the distribution of leaflets on the markets or in the cities by militants and the prohibition of unions which do not conform to the official ideology.</p>

To ensure that we can do so we need a significant degree of moral, as well as political authority, it is important to examine whether or not there have been abuses of human rights within our own Member States. There are a number of issues in my own country which are of concern to me.</p>
<p class="contents">Firstly, our treatment of refugees and asylum seekers leaves a lot to be desired. Secondly, I am also concerned at the implications arising out of the current industrial dispute at Ryanair. Workers at Ryanair are being denied the opportunity to organize and have trade union representation. The company has reacted to a reasonable and legitimate request with an attitude reminiscent of employers in Dickensian times. I am very disappointed that neither European nor national Irish law enshrines directly the basic rights of trade union membership or representation.</p>
<p class="contents">I would urge Commissioner Flynn to intervene in this dispute. He should convene a meeting of the relevant national authorities of the EU countries into which Ryanair fly to ascertain whether or not their national legislation can be used to protect the rights of Ryanair employees. In his role as Commissioner for Social Affairs, he can consider what other course of action he might be able to take to bring this dispute to an end, in particular as it threatens the social partnership in Ireland which has been so vital to the successful performance of the Irish economy.</p>

 Mr President, I have voted for this report on human rights, even though the concept of human rights as presented in this report does not conform to my own precise and rather legalistic idea of human rights. However, I see nothing wrong in our including political objectives in a political debate and in a report about human rights. That is why I have supported and voted for this report.</p>

 We would like to thank the rapporteur for what is in many areas an important report. We think that attention must be paid to respect for human rights in the European Union. However, we believe that before the forthcoming discussions on the subject, the European Parliament must ensure that there is a greater concentration of questions.</p>
<p class="contents">The present report covers far too many areas, which in large parts makes the report too generalized. What may be seen as justified criticism concerning circumstances which apply to one or more Member States, can, for other Member States, appear as unfounded opinions which lack clarity about what is actually intended. A number of questions concerning asylum policy and the question of not allowing local authorities to ban begging are examples of this.</p>
<p class="contents">We are strong supporters of a humane and generous asylum policy. We also think that the social problems which create a need for people to support themselves through begging must be combated. However, flaws in the asylum policies of one or more Member States cannot form the basis of demands for measures which apply to all Member States. The differences between the countries are too great for that. Similarly, differences in the Member States' abilities to deal with the problem of poverty must be respected in the view on begging. We would particularly like to emphasize our support for Amendments Nos 36 and 41. The view of prostitution put forward in paragraph 86 of the report is totally unacceptable.</p>
<p class="contents">Finally, we would like to underline our support for the report's clear repudiation of racism and xenophobia.</p>

So I think it is regrettable that today, as in other years, I had to vote against the report.</p>
<p class="contents">I did not vote gainst the report because I disagree with everything in it, but because, to my mind, its intention undermines the credibility of the Union in this field. Over the years the report"s contents have become so politically coloured that by now it has little to do with a neutral and fair monitoring of the observance of human rights as we know them from the EHRC. Classic human rights are lumped together with social, cultural and economic rights. Social and economic rights are presented through a politically coloured interpretation as fundamental human rights. This is also the case with asylum policy. Please note that I do recognize the right to asylum as a fundamental human rights, but the interpretation of this down to the last detail does not belong in the report. The Member States do retain a certain degree of policy freedom in this.</p>
<p class="contents">These are merely a few examples. Are the rights to divorce and to abortion really the most fundamental human rights which we would like to hold up to the world? Where is the right to life, granted to us by God? What kind of values and value patterns is indicated by this one‐sided approach? I could imagine that the developing countries might not be able to take us so seriously after reading a report of this kind. In any case, I, for one, cannot. All qualification is missing, and political party thoughts are turned into fundamental human rights. The notion of human rights used here is very different from the one I adhere to. We see human rights primarily as rights granted by God, whereby rights can never be claimed without honouring the notion of responsibility. That is why my colleague, Rijk van Dam, and I in the end voted against this report.</p>

 I approve of this report for the most part, even if it sometimes gives the impression of being a cover‐all for every good intention in the world.</p>
<p class="contents">But clearly, given the worrying political tendencies in some Member States – xenophobia, racism and nationalism –, it is useful for Parliament to reflect deeply every year on all of these problems as a whole.</p>
<p class="contents">For my part, I would like to praise in particular the section of the report which deals with poverty. With 16 % of people below the poverty level in the EU, some 57 million people, according to the definition of poverty – having an income of less than half the country"s average –, the EU, one of the richest areas of the world, has reached an unacceptable level of misery. Poverty is linked to social exclusion, and thus to the unemployment which Europe has not managed to stamp out.</p>
<p class="contents">I join with the rapporteur in her vigorous denunciation of certain states, in particular Germany, which refuse to implement the EU action programmes on poverty. This does not bode well for the implementation of the recommendations of the Luxembourg Summit on employment.</p>
<p class="contents">I also join with her in her demand for a policy of growth and revival of purchasing power and employment.</p>

 The fact that human rights should be protected and respected is, of course, self‐evident to Members of the European Parliament. That is why we are also voting for the report as a whole.</p>
<p class="contents">Unfortunately, it also includes a number of demands and requests with which we do not agree, such as the following: </p>
<p class="contents">‐ we do not think that the EU should sign up to the Council of Europe's Convention, because that would require the EU to be a legal person, a state; </p>
<p class="contents">‐ we do not think that wages, social welfare systems and so on, should be regulated at Community level. However, it should go without saying that the Member States should make greater efforts to comply with the international conventions which they have signed; </p>
<p class="contents">‐ we do not agree with the report's view of prostitution, whether in the assertion that adults ‚...of their own free will, choose prostitution as an occupation...’, or that the Council should lay down measures and possibly regulate such activities.</p>
<p class="contents">‐ we distance ourselves from paragraph 127 which is much too vague and leaves a lot of room for interpretation, so there is a risk that freedom of religion could be restricted.</p>
<p class="contents">Generally, it can be said that the report contains a number of demands and requests which should not be seen as human rights, but rather as general political opinions.</p>

 The Danish Social Democrats in the European Parliament have today voted in favour of a report which takes the pulse of the human rights situation in the EU in 1996. It is a very good tradition that the European Parliament ensures that we sweep our own doorstep in the EU once a year. But if this is not simply to be empty words, we should focus our criticisms and look at how serious conditions are at present. It is very unfortunate that, in two of the matters on which Denmark was criticized, the questions are not relevant. The provisions on forced labour in Danish criminal law have never been used and are in the process of being abolished. The system of limited rights to strike for civil servants is also being changed.</p>
<p class="contents">Denmark has also been criticized for allowing exclusive agreements. It is worth noting, firstly, that the Danish have not had any referrals from the committee of experts of the Council of Europe, and secondly, judgments in Denmark have found in favour of exclusive agreements. Exclusive agreements concern the right to enter into collective agreements and the basic right of employees to be given notice of dismissal, minimum wage, labour market pensions, and so on. Exclusive agreements are one of the reasons why Denmark has a peaceful, efficient labour market with a record low number of working days lost.</p>
<p class="contents">It is therefore regrettable that the middle‐class forces in the European Parliament are pursuing a political populism in such an important report on human rights. There are enormous numbers of infringements of human rights within the Union. EU citizens face discrimination on the grounds of ethnic origin, religion, sexuality and disabilities. It is this discrimination which we would like to draw attention to in the annual report on human rights in the EU.</p>

 The battle for human rights is one of the EU's and the European Parliament's most important tasks. The rapporteur, Mrs Pailler, has done a very praiseworthy job in the area of human rights in the EU. However, the report extends the concept of human rights to cover a number of political areas, which tend to take the form of political programmes, such as economic and social problems. Even though we can agree with most of this, it could easily detract from criticism of breaches of human rights on the basis of the way the concept is defined in the UN and in the Council of Europe.</p>
<p class="contents">The programme should have been more concerned with the rights of minorities, such as Austria's treatment of homosexuals, the Slovak Republic's treatment of Hungarians, Hungary's and Romania's treatment of gypsies, and so on. An obvious human right such as safety on the streets is not touched on at all. However, I have still voted for the report, since my criticisms are of a more formal nature.</p>

For this very reason, Mrs Aline Pailler"s excellent report is very welcome since it very eloquently prevents this from happening. It is for its commendable intention that it was approved by the Committee on Civil Liberties and Internal Affairs by only one vote and reached the House with so many amendments, some of which seek to enhance it and many others which wish to deprive it of its essential character.</p>
<p class="contents">This does not mean that the draft resolution did not ensure that it would win the approval of the House. It opted to take a frontal approach, to provoke controversy rather than consensus and the possibility of arriving at a resolution that allows action and practices to be reinforced, with a view to improving the human rights situation in an area of the world where some people consider that they have the standing to give lessons on human rights to those who live in other places, forgetting that their own houses are made of glass.</p>
<p class="contents">This effort to ensure that the European Parliament arrives at a resolution that is worthy of it and that has practical effects is borne out by what may be considered to be an imbalance between the explanatory statement and the draft resolution. Care was taken not to include in the draft resolutions matters that might be inferred from explicit references in the explanatory statement, particularly as regards specific countries and situations.</p>
<p class="contents">For example, Portugal is mentioned several times in the explanatory statement – in connection with child labour, the situation of prisoners, particularly as regards drug dependency, and the excessive length of court procedures. But care was taken not to reflect in the text of the draft resolution any explicit reference to what underlies it. This makes it possible for anybody who accepts the principles and rejects such situations in the abstract, but who is reluctant to condemn them when they feel jointly responsible – or those whom the cap fits – to vote for the text.</p>
<p class="contents">Finally, I would like to emphasize another point that has emerged very clearly from the debate, both in committee and here in the House. This concerns the concept of human rights. We agree entirely with the perspective of the report"s author when she adopts the concept in its broadest sense and does not lay human rights on the doorstep of the economy, as though social rights such as the right to work, housing, education, social protection and culture had nothing to do with the economic policy selected in the service of very specific and private economic and financial interests. In the same way, we do not accept that anybody should seek to counter the rapporteur"s position by invoking an insidious symmetry which makes the human right to work equivalent to the so‐called right and freedom to enterprise based on the exploitation of the labour force, as though this were a right of some men and women with a status equivalent to the right all men and women have to a dignified life on the basis of their contribution to the social whole.</p>

) The signatories to this explanation of the vote fully support the contents of points 52 and 59 of Mrs Pailler's report on the terms of freedom of association and organization which need to be dealt with. In reality, however, implementing these provisions would undermine the efficient Danish trade union system and the rights associated with it. For this reason, we cannot vote in favour of points 52 and 59, although their content is otherwise good.</p>
<p class="contents">We also find it meaningless for the EU to ratify the European Convention on Human Rights, as it would put the EU on an equal footing with the independent states of Europe. As such, it would merely be an attempt to present the EU as an independent state, a development we cannot support. At the same time, for the EU to ratify the European Convention on Human Rights would undoubtedly be to water down the status of the Convention, and would mean that European states would be less worried about meeting its requirements.</p>

 It is typical of the lack of this Parliament"s seriousness in general, and of the Committee on Civil Liberties in particular, that a report on human rights in the European Union is entrusted to an elected member of the French Communist Party. This remark is not intended personally; I only observe that the report deemed it necessary to lace this report with MarxistLeninist business which does not belong there.</p>
<p class="contents">In particular – in the name of human rights, if you please – a repression of freedom of speech for all those who do not agree with this multicultural dogma is argued for. Mrs Pailler obviously has not learnt any lessons from the communist ideology which she represents. On the contrary, she wants to guarantee freedom of speech only for those who agree with her. The others are at best allowed to remain silent, or are punished. When I read this I am no longer amazed that the French Communist Party to this day has not distanced itself from the worst communist crimes of the recent past, just like it no longer amazes me that this Parliament"s socialist group supports the Pailler report.</p>
<p class="contents">The socialists have always been the communists" perfect fellow travellers; the latter from conviction, the former petrified they will break the rule of political correctness.</p>
<p class="contents">On behalf of human rights, Mrs Pailler also wants to curtail freedom of speech within this Parliament. Like her colleagues, Mr Schulz and Mr Ford, it bothers her that in this hemisphere, for merely a couple of minutes, a few representatives of the Flemish Bloc or the National Front have a dissident voice. It is truly typical that it has to be a report on human rights which argues for the gagging of democratically elected people to this Parliament and within it. It is even more typical that none of the representatives of the Christian Democrats or the Liberals opposed these proposals. They may vote against, but they lack the courage to say so openly.</p>
<p class="contents">It is this cowardice which makes it possible for totalitarian regimes to install themselves.</p>

 In my opinion, a report on this subject should deal with attacks on fundamental human rights such as the freedom of speech, freedom of the press, freedom of religion and freedom of association. Similarly, it should examine and remark on whether, for example, the right to legal representation or the right to be allowed to do non‐military service are fulfilled in the EU's Member States. But to do as this report does, and extend the concept to include the designation of European days for the rights of the child and for the 150th anniversary of the abolition of slavery, and so on, is not what this subject area concerns. The designation of European days is solely aimed at trying to create a common culture to facilitate the building of a ‚United States of Europe’. That has no place here. In an international context, ’human rights’ has a relatively clear meaning.</p>
<p class="contents">Paragraph 56 of the draft report condemns municipal authorities which ban begging in their areas. If you express yourself in such a way in a report, it means that you accept begging as an income‐earning activity for a number of citizens. I cannot accept that. Begging should not happen in the Community. Every citizen should be guaranteed a basic level of security in the Community through social services.</p>
<p class="contents">Paragraph 85 of the draft report urges Member States to revise the existing rules which permit forced sterilization, and it calls for a moratorium on forced sterilization until this revision has been completed. In connection with this, it may be observed that Sweden already banned forced sterilizations in 1975.</p>
<p class="contents">There are also a number of other formulations in this large report which should not be there at all, or should in any case have been worded differently. To express yourself as the draft report does and urge the Member States and the Council to ‚lay down measures to protect...adults who, of their own free will, choose prostitution as an occupation and possibly to contemplate regulating such an activity.’ In Sweden we regulated this activity until the beginning of the 1900s in a way which is in line with the report's intentions. It proved to be a totally unsuccessful policy.</p>

<img align="absmiddle" alt="" src="/doceo/data/img/arrow_summary.gif"/>  <span class="doc_subtitle_level1_bis">Prescott, </span> <span class="italic">President‐in‐Office of the Council</span>. – Mr President, Commissioner, honourable Members, right at the beginning you pose a dilemma for me as an ex‐seaman. On shipping, I can tell you that I am concerned about duty‐free and the consequential effects of it. So, whilst I would like you to hear the speeches we have to make about Kyoto, I also want you to fix your attention on the implications of that duty‐free rule in regard to the travelling public. I will not say any more in case I get myself into trouble with finance ministers in these matters – but it has given me the opportunity to make the point and I hope the Commissioner has taken it on board.</p>
<p class="contents">I am pleased and, indeed, honoured to be able to address you today both as the President‐in‐Office and also as a former leader of the British Labour Group, a vice‐president of the Socialist Group in the European Parliament, admittedly in the non‐elected days and some time ago. Britain has the privilege of holding the Presidency of the European Union at an important time and in particular with regard to the growing environmental problems. These problems, as we know, are often man‐made. They can usually only be resolved by a common approach. Kyoto showed us how the European Union can lead the world in tackling global problems.</p>
<p class="contents">I was one of those who was involved with a number of other members in the troika and the European Environment Council, and make no mistake about it: Europe as a partner in those negotiations was a considerable force acting together to achieve a global solution. I do not think that can be underestimated. The Commission will confirm that was a very important influence in securing this agreement.</p>
<p class="contents">Working closely with the European Parliament, we believe we can make a real difference to the environment and improve people's quality of life in the European Union. I greatly admire your Committee on the Environment, Public Health and Consumer Protection with its constructive and very comprehensive reports. For example, the committee is giving a high priority to the ambitious programme to review and update the legislation on water quality. Indeed, I look forward to coming back to Parliament during our Presidency. With Ken Collins in the chair I know the committee will continue to keep the Council on its toes. (That's what I was to say, Ken, was not it?)</p>
<p class="contents"><span class="italic"><span class="italic">(Laughter)</span> </span></p>
<p class="contents">We have taken three issues of real concern to the people of Europe as key themes for the British Presidency: jobs, crime and the environment. We want to place the environmental considerations at the heart of the European Union's decision‐making process. Integrating environmental issues into all policy areas of the European Union will be a major task but one that we have to face. It will be an exciting process and in the long term more effective in bringing greater accountability. It will challenge a great deal of the traditional thinking about our decision‐making. That is the same whether in national parliaments or in the decision‐making process of the European Union. We have made a big step forward with the Amsterdam Treaty and I look forward to Commissioner Bjerregaard reporting at the Cardiff European Council in June. I shall return to this important issue later.</p>
<p class="contents">We have also identified six major environmental issues to move forward on during our Presidency: transport and the environment – a matter I am very much concerned with as the Secretary of State in my own country for transport and environment, amongst the many other titles I am given from time to time; air pollution; biodiversity; fisheries; enlargement of the European Union; and climate change.</p>
<p class="contents">Today, in this debate, I shall focus on climate change but will touch briefly on other issues. As far as transport and the environment are concerned, the new government in Britain has merged our two departments. We believe we can deliver a more sustainable transport policy. I have extended this initiative to our Presidency by planning to hold a joint transport and environment council in June, preceded by an informal session in April in Chester.</p>
<p class="contents">This morning in Strasbourg I saw for myself how an impressive tram system tackles the problems of congestion and pollution that afflict so many of our towns and cities and encourages greater use of public transport and less use of the private car. We need to pursue a twin‐track approach. We need to reduce the environmental impact of car use. That is why the Auto‐Oil programme will make a major impact on reducing emissions.</p>
<p class="contents">The Presidency will also launch a new initiative at our informal council in Chester. This will encourage low‐emission or noemission vehicles. It will bring together European cities prepared to give preferential access rights to these vehicles. We will also hold an exhibition of clean car technology in Chester. We are all agreed that it is essential to cut CO<span class="sub">2</span>
 emissions from transport, which are growing faster than in any other sector. We must progress the Commission's strategy to reduce CO<span class="sub">2</span>
 emissions from new cars.</p>
<p class="contents">However, the Commission's negotiations for a voluntary agreement from the European car industry remain deadlocked. The industry's offer to reduce emissions is inadequate and we have to make that clear. If the voluntary approach cannot be made to work, we have said that we will consider regulatory or fiscal alternatives. I am delighted that Michael Meacher, the British Minister of the Environment, and the Commissioner will be here tomorrow for a workshop on CO<span class="sub">2</span>
 emissions from cars.</p>
<p class="contents">Our second issue is air pollution. To achieve a reduction, action must be taken at Community, national and local levels and the air quality daughter directive is a main priority, as is the Auto‐Oil programme that I have already mentioned. As for acid rain, further Community measures are needed to reduce the sulphur content of certain liquid fuels. Reaching agreement will be one of the priorities for our June Environment Council.</p>
<p class="contents">The third issue we wish to progress is that of biodiversity on which we now have a European Union strategy. We will discuss this at the March Environment Council as we prepare for the fourth meeting of the Conference of parties in Bratislava in May.</p>
<p class="contents">With regard to fisheries, environmental integration is absolutely important. We must review the action taken to follow up commitments made at the March 1997 meeting of the North Sea Fisheries and Environmental Ministers. This will include steps to stop over‐fishing in the North Sea, and it is particularly important in this, the International Year of the Ocean, to phase out the use of high seas drift nets which kill so many dolphins and other non‐target species.</p>
<p class="contents"><span class="italic"><span class="italic">(Applause)</span> </span></p>
<p class="contents">Our fifth issue, namely enlargement, will focus on the integration of environmental considerations during those negotiations.</p>
<p class="contents">Finally, on the most important issue, that of climate change, I would like to comment on the talks held in Kyoto last December. As Parliament itself predicted, the Kyoto Conference was indeed a watershed in the global climate change debate. Seeking consensus between 160 countries on issues which could not be decided by a vote was always difficult, as I am sure people are well aware in a democratic assembly such as this. That is why we had a lot of pre‐discussions. The Commissioner and many of our colleagues held talks with key countries prior to Kyoto. I myself travelled twice around the globe meeting leaders of the developed and developing countries and was criticised by the NGOs for creating so much pollution.</p>
<p class="contents">In Kyoto, despite the positions of the major players starting poles apart, as indeed they were, after gruelling negotiations we came away with what I believe is a historic agreement. It was not everything that we wanted, but it was an important, historic first step. We should not underestimate that, nor the role that the European Union played in bringing that about. Legally binding reductions of more than 5 % in the emissions of greenhouse gases by the developed countries was agreed. And Europe, as I said, can be proud of the leading role it played. The Troika ministers and the Commissioner had tremendous support and back‐up from our officials. Please do not underestimate: we had the best official back‐up team that any negotiating body could have had. I would like to place on record our great appreciation because they played no small part in bringing about that agreement.</p>
<p class="contents">I would also like to pay tribute to all the European Union ministers at Kyoto – the environment ministers – whose solidarity and commitment played such a vital role in Europe's contribution to securing a successful agreement. It was not easy going; we were not all agreed; we had different points of view. There was one occasion when the Japanese minister was complaining to me that, ’you do not understand, Mr Prescott’, when I was trying to force him along with the Troika to a better deal, that ‚I have to explain it to my Prime Minister’. I had to explain that I had 15 representatives of 15 Prime Ministers in the room next door and that was a much more difficult proposition. But their solidarity was a key factor in getting across a united European approach that gave us the leading position in those environmental discussions and agreements. Indeed, when you look at it, the United States was persuaded to move from zero – when most people said they would not move from that, that it was their bottom line. They moved to 7 %. Canada and Japan moved from a 2.5 % to a 6 % cut and the European Union set the top standard with a cut of 8 %, a target which was actually adopted by a total of 26 of the other 38 countries who took part in the targets. They adopted our target and because they did, we were able to make a substantial cut in greenhouse gases over the period of time for this negotiation and agreement.</p>
<p class="contents">Success at Kyoto was down to consensus among governments that climate change is real and that something has got to be done about it. Nobody questions any more the science. It is clear that we have to do something. That was particularly clear at Kyoto. As I said before, it is only a first step, but an important first step. It is nowhere near sufficient to tackle the problem in the longer term. It falls to the British Presidency and our successors, Austria, to prepare for the important fourth Climate Change Conference of the Parties in Buenos Aires in November.</p>
<p class="contents">The first priority must be to complete the unfinished business of Kyoto, particularly the rules for the flexibilities of the Protocol. This is still the most important role that the European Union has to make. Emission trading, carbon sinks, joint implementation, the modalities of a clean, development mechanism all need to be worked out and agreed. There is great suspicion that these flexibilities might provide the opportunities for certain big countries to trade off their obligations without doing something to their domestic economies. The European Union needs to make clear that that is an unacceptable proposition; that every country has an obligation – particularly developed nations – to make that contribution to the cuts in their own domestic economies. Therefore we must ensure that these deliver real, cost‐effective and verifiable environmental benefits and do not create loopholes to be exploited and abused and which undermine the objectives of the Protocol. It is my view that if these rules are not satisfactory, countries will refuse to ratify. We will not achieve what got off to such a brave start at Kyoto if we do not have the courage to make clear that this is not a back door; these are not loopholes to avoid the commitment to make the changes in our domestic economy to achieve the reduction in greenhouse gases in order to secure the climatic change benefits that will come from it.</p>
<p class="contents">Indeed this is why we pushed the European initiative – what we call the window of credibility – to buy time for a proper framework to be put into place. The concept of a window of credibility stems from our realization that these rules could not be agreed at Kyoto in time, but that the period from signing in March to ratification, however long that may be, gives us an opportunity to work out these rules. The next challenge is to see if we can achieve this within the window of credibility. We now have to prove that those rules are workable.</p>
<p class="contents">Beyond that, we need to start discussing with developing countries how their emissions can be reduced in a way that does not conflict with their aspirations for economic growth and eradication of poverty. There is much suspicion in the developing countries that we wish to impose a different level of economic growth and a different process of industrialization to their disadvantage. But many of those countries can see that the production of greenhouse gases, that comes with the early stages of industrialization, contributes as deadly a climate change challenge as they do to developed countries. We have made a start by showing we are prepared to take action. But make no mistake: developing countries growing like China have their contribution to make. That will be an important matter for us to look at. It was right that we, as developed countries, took the lead at Kyoto in committing ourselves to those legally binding targets. But it is a fact that China will overtake the United States as the largest emitter of greenhouse gases in the next 20 to 30 years. We have to work out how to handle developing countries' emissions in a very fair way. The European Union, therefore, has an opportunity to act as a broker between the developed and the developing countries. The UK will be using the Presidency to drive this challenging agenda forward in the European Union over the coming months.</p>
<p class="contents">We will also be hosting various major international meetings: the European Union‐ASEAN Summit in April; the G8 Summit in May; and the EU‐US Summit in the same month. We will ensure that climate change is high on the agenda for discussion.</p>
<p class="contents">For the two Environmental Councils during our Presidency we have three priorities on climate change. First, we must share out the EU 8 % reduction target between Member States under the rules of our European bubble. I will bring forward a proposal for agreement at the June Council.</p>
<p class="contents">Secondly, we must decide which policies and measures are necessary at the European level to meet that 8 % target. Setting a target is one thing; getting the policies implemented to achieve it is quite another. We have to begin to face that. The Commission's strategy will be absolutely critical here.</p>
<p class="contents">Thirdly, we must prepare the European Union position for the international negotiations with Buenos Aires later this year. It will cover the unfinished business from Kyoto. Issues such as emissions trading, the clean‐development mechanisms, sinks and joint implementations sound like a range of sound‐bites, but they are absolutely critical if Kyoto is to be translated from a statement of aims and legal objectives and targets to one of actual implementation for the achievement of reducing greenhouse gas emissions in order to secure the environmental changes we are committed to achieve.</p>
<p class="contents">I also hope that the Community can sign the Protocol during our Presidency. The Commission is bringing forward a proposal for this. Ratification is a longer‐term issue and will depend, amongst other things, on satisfactory progress on issues such as the rules on trading. There is much to be done but, with the close cooperation, and indeed a shared purpose, which exists between the Member States, together with the Commission and other Community institutions, we can and must succeed.</p>
<p class="contents">Kyoto will be remembered as a place where the world faced a crucial decision, made the right choice and demonstrated the willingness to take collective action and to recognize also that this world does not just belong to our generation: we hold it in trust for our children's children. That is the obligation: to pass on a world that is safe in sustainable environment circumstances.</p>
<p class="contents">Climate change shows just how important it is for the environment issue to be addressed across a wide range of policies. It underlines the importance of the new strategy which I mentioned earlier, and which I wish to say a couple of words about. This is almost a challenge to our decision‐making processes. We can set the targets, we can establish the policies, we can achieve those objectives we have set for ourselves. But there is also, as with change, a challenge to our whole decision‐making process. We can do better by changing our decision‐making process as much as by changing policies and establishing higher targets.</p>
<p class="contents">The Amsterdam Treaty recognized this and introduced a new requirement for the integration of the environment and other policies. I recall my early days here in the late 1970s as a Member of this institution. We then used to argue whether it was called an assembly or a parliament. I will not get into that argument now: it is clearly called the European Parliament. I remember the debates of that time when we talked about regional policy, and I belonged to a fishing port that had lost all its fishing possibilities by joining the European Community: we lost our distant waters. We wanted to restructure the fishing industry in Hull.</p>
<p class="contents">I could go to one department which would tell me that I could have redundancy money for fishing, something for training, something for restructuring, and something for looking to some other facility, but we were unable to bring them together in an integrated way that could develop the assets which were being made redundant by that industrial change.</p>
<p class="contents">That is the challenge for us on the environmental issues. The Community already has a fifth environmental action programme which does some of this. I know that a lot more has been done since those times and I congratulate Parliament on what it has done. There is likely to be a successor after the year 2000 with regard to the fifth environmental action programme.</p>
<p class="contents">In the meantime, the United Kingdom Presidency is ensuring that the environment is discussed in such Councils as agriculture, fisheries and energy and it is holding a joint Environment/Transport Council which will begin to integrate the necessary policies to achieve the targets that we have set and establish what we have to do in those policies that will be decided by the European Union.</p>
<p class="contents">The Heads of Government have asked the Commission to produce a specific strategy on integration and present it to the Cardiff Summit in June, which the Commissioner will do. I know Commissioner Bjerregaard is working on this and I would like to express my deepest appreciation for the Commission and for the role that she and her department played in the settlement of the Kyoto agreement. It was a very good example of how the political forces and the Commission can work together to achieve an objective, not only to the benefit of Europe, but a better global solution as well.</p>
<p class="contents">Therefore, in my view, a strategy that will give high‐level political impetus to integration is needed. I expect that it will highlight some of the major areas of policy where the environment has to be fully integrated. Areas like climate change, energy and transport, for example, are so integrated you cannot make a decision in one area without implications for the other. It is important we understand the integrated process under which you can achieve a far higher objective than by dealing with them separately. It is my hope that we will also be suggesting a new integrated mechanism to carry things forward.</p>
<p class="contents">This strategy can be seen as phase 1, and we will need a phase 2 and phase 3. We need to have something to ensure that the Heads of Government and the Council of Ministers return to this regularly and can be judged upon their actions. It could be a form of a rolling programme of environmental audit, and I am looking forward to discussing this with the Commissioner. I also hope to discuss it with the next three presidencies taking us up to the year 2000. Those who give political leadership must see the whole picture and make the connections between the economic, environment and social issues. We have to break out of the habit of thinking in a fragmented way.</p>
<p class="contents">We have set ourselves a demanding Presidency agenda, as indeed each Presidency rightly claims. But this reflects the high importance we attach to tackling environmental matters.</p>
<p class="contents">Success will depend very much on the relationship between the Commission, the Council and this Parliament. I hope this will be a close and productive relationship. I have every reason to believe that it will be. I am glad to have had this opportunity to speak to you today and thank you for hearing me.</p>

<img align="absmiddle" alt="" src="/doceo/data/img/arrow_summary.gif"/>  <span class="doc_subtitle_level1_bis">Bjerregaard, </span> <span class="italic">Member of the Commission. – (DA)</span>
 Mr President, ladies and gentlemen, I would like to start by thanking John Prescott for his comments on the Presidency's priorities on the environment. There are many of these, and they are important, and I am very happy about working together. But I would also like to take this opportunity to thank John Prescott for his contribution to the climate conference in Kyoto. He gave the climate debate colour and substance, and with his personal commitment, he helped achieve the results which we are now discussing a second time here in Parliament. I had – as you will remember – an opportunity to discuss the results immediately after we came back in December. I gave my initial assessment of what we had achieved and I also felt we had a good debate, so I will try and avoid repeating what we discussed then.</p>
<p class="contents">It is clear that the Protocol is the first decisive step towards a global solution of the climate problem. It is the first time the industrialized nations have approved a text which contains legally binding limits on their emissions of greenhouse gases, and so now, as we are trying to do, the next step is to turn the Protocol into law and ensure that the tools for implementing it are effective. As you will know, this assumes the major industrial nations ratify the agreement.</p>
<p class="contents">It is important – as John Prescott emphasized – that we do not forget the developing countries in this process. The Kyoto conference affects them too. As we are aware, they are not at fault in the present accumulation of greenhouse gases, but of course they also have to live with the consequences of our policy, and so these countries are clear about the need for a viable development and expect – rightly so, I think – that the industrialized nations will take the first step. But, apart from ratification and any considerations as to when the appropriate time for such ratification is in political terms, there is still a lot of uncertainty which must be clarified.</p>
<p class="contents">So what has happened since then, and what are we doing to ensure that the follow‐up to Kyoto is fast and effective? The first thing to do is to prepare for the Community's signing of the Protocol. The Protocol will be available for signature from 16 March 1998 to 15 March 1999. And it is vital that, as the leaders in the negotiations, we Europeans ensure that the Community signs the Protocol as soon as possible. In doing so, we will be sending the right signals out to the other parties involved, some of whom of course may be inclined to take their time over things. It will also give industry and other economic players, as well as the Community's citizens, more clarity about the situation. The Commission has a proposal ready for signature, and it will be presented to the Council in good time for the Ministers to approve it at the next Environmental Council on 23 March. And of course we must hope that Member States also sign the Protocol soon.</p>
<p class="contents">The positive results we achieved at Kyoto were largely due to the EU's leadership, and – as we have emphasized here today – the outstanding cooperation between the troika and the Member States. It is important to sustain this leadership, especially when we see the situation in the US. We have to work at two levels: we must ensure that our own arrangements, such as distributing the load, finally take shape at the Council meeting in June and we can draw up a strategy for meeting our obligations. We must also ensure that our approach matches the negotiating position we will be adopting at the Buenos Aires meeting. Such a consistent, coordinated approach can also help us in our relations with other parties in the coming months, and so I would like to look briefly at the different components of this strategy.</p>
<p class="contents">Like Parliament, I would like to see the EU adopt more ambitious goals and go further than an 8 % reduction. It is important that the EU retain its leading role. The Presidency has said that it hopes that the Environmental Council can reach unanimity, which John Prescott has also emphasized here today. On this point, we have to bear in mind that three new gases have been included. Before the Kyoto meeting, the Commission produced a communication which showed that the Community had significant potential for reducing emissions which would not have adverse effects on the economy. We drew attention to CO<span class="sub">2</span>
 and showed that it was possible to achieve a more viable and purer energy consumption by tightening up policies and arrangements and providing the appropriate incentives. I propose to submit a communication which can be taken up at the Council meeting in June. We will raise all these factors and the Commission's attitude to the flexibility provisions. In this way, we will have defined the guidelines for the Community when it is time to start meeting the obligations in the Protocol.</p>
<p class="contents">On this point, I would very much like to emphasize the provisions of the Protocol requiring the industrialized parties to show that they have made progress in meeting their obligations by 2005. This means we must get to work implementing national policies and arrangements. If any Member States believe that they can just make do with dealing in emission quotas, which have not even been set yet, they will be unable to meet their commitments. The flexibility provisions will not give any major results – in fact, virtually no results whatsoever – by that time. The Protocol clearly states that these mechanisms are designed to be supplementary to countries' own efforts. This concept is not defined in more detail in terms of percentages. Only one of the flexibility mechanisms, that is, saving credits under the clean development fund mechanism may enter into force by the end of the first commitment period which starts in 2000.</p>
<p class="contents">The flexibility provisions concern – as John Prescott underlined – trading in emission quotas, joint implementation and mechanisms for clean development, the so‐called clean development fund. The Commission is in the process of preparing an analysis of the Protocol for the Environmental Council meeting in March, at which a number of these questions will be examined in more detail. On the other hand, the analysis will not have all the answers, as the more detailed economic and legal work is still incomplete. We must ensure that the international rules on flexibility mechanisms are justified and that the Community and the special position of the single market are taken proper account of. It is vital that the Community and its Member States resolve these questions as soon as possible before the preparatory meeting in Bonn in June and the Buenos Aires meeting in November.</p>
<p class="contents">The Protocol will not take effect until it is ratified by 55 parties, not least the industrialised nations, which accounted for over 55 % of the nations' CO<span class="sub">2</span>
 emissions in 1990. The attitude of the USA and Russia is of decisive importance here. The two countries together account for approximately 45 % of the industrialised nations' CO<span class="sub">2</span>
 emissions from using energy in 1990. Unless these countries are on board, it will put implementation of the Protocol at risk. How Russia responds will presumably depend on the US, and the news from Washington is not good. The US must now live up to its responsibilities and ratify the Protocol and we must use all our efforts to bring this about. It is important to convince the US administration, Congress and people that the Protocol is in their own interests in the long term, and that the USA should sign and ratify it as soon as possible. Likewise, we must use all the opportunities available to get Russia to come round to our views, and I am very pleased at the remarks which John Prescott made about the Presidency's plans to bring the subject up at the different meetings which will be held under the British Presidency. Members of the European Parliament also have an important role to play here. One of the key factors for ratification by those countries is that we find a solution to a number of vital questions which the Protocol leaves open, the so‐called flexibility mechanisms to which I have just referred.</p>
<p class="contents">As far as the developing countries are concerned, the Community has always sought to take account of their particular situation and needs. We have always emphasized that, under the Berlin mandate, we did not expect the developing countries to commit themselves to reducing emissions. This is the reason why I, for one, am pleased that the attempt to get commitments out of the developing countries at Kyoto failed. Nevertheless, we must recognise that climate change is a global problem and that we will have to include the developing countries in the process at a later stage. I believe the Community will have to act as a bridge between the industrialized nations which are demanding more involvement now and the developing countries themselves. With this in mind, we must be clear about our position. We must also be clear that we cannot treat the developing countries as a single group: we have to take account of their different views and priorities. Parliament also has a major role to play here, such as through the EU‐ACP Joint Assembly.</p>
<p class="contents">Mr President, I hope my statement has answered some of the questions you would like. I have tried to give you food for thought on a number of questions which have to be solved if we are to ensure that the Kyoto Protocol achieves the desired effect. I believe that, thanks to the Commission's work at present, I will be able to give you more news of developments in the coming months. I am confident that Parliament will continue to support the approach of the Commission and Presidency and I look forward to working with both the Presidency and Parliament in the run‐up to the Buenos Aires conference.</p>

Collins </span> <span class="bold">(PSE).</span> – Mr President, first of all may I welcome to Parliament the President of the Environment Council and Deputy Prime Minister of the United Kingdom and thank him for his kind comments directed at the Environment Committee.</p>
<p class="contents">It is certainly heartening to see that the United Kingdom has made environment a priority of the Presidency. I think that is very good indeed and we can all support it. However, although, if I may say so, I have no wish to pour cold water over the President's ambitions for the next six months, I know he is well aware that the activity of one Presidency can only be successful if it involves the activities of the succeeding Presidencies. I can tell from his own speech and from what he has stated earlier that he is well aware of that, as well as of the need to cooperate with the Austrians, Germans and then the Finns. Nevertheless it has to be emphasized that presidencies do play an important facilitating role.</p>
<p class="contents">I would now like to move on to the issues of climate change and air quality, the latter being an issue which I know is of some considerable interest to my friend and colleague, Mr Miller. It is clear that environmental protection is a cross‐sectoral and international issue. Climate change is an apposite example to illustrate the case. The burning of fossil fuels in one Member State affects not only the local environment but global weather patterns. The El Niño phenomenon is a graphic example of the potential impact of climate change on a global environment.</p>
<p class="contents">We in Parliament were very pleased that an agreement was reached at Kyoto on cutting CO<span class="sub">2</span>
 emissions. However, one or two points nonetheless need to be made. It is a pity, from our point of view, that the agreed limits for CO<span class="sub">2</span>
 emissions were not even more stringent, although I do accept entirely how difficult the task facing the European negotiators was. What we need now, however, is for the Commission to consider how we are to disaggregate responsibility for cutting CO<span class="sub">2</span>
 emissions. Specific proposals setting out how Member States are expected to achieve standards must be brought forward and specific limits for each Member State set so that we know how it is we are going to achieve our targets. This is a matter of the utmost urgency. Without it, we have the prospect of a set of standards agreed across the European Union based on an agreement that each State will share the burden of reaching limits – the so‐called ‚bubble’ which some Member States, left to their own devices, will do very little to implement. If we allow this to happen we will not achieve our European Union targets.</p>
<p class="contents">These considerations must also be taken into account at a broader global level in the context of the agreement on emission trading. All of this involves the Auto‐Oil programme. It means bringing together our energy and transport policies as well as our agricultural policies. We really need to have much more integration of environmental considerations into all policy areas.</p>
<p class="contents">The draft Treaty of Amsterdam provides a crucial first step towards this integration. We need to start preparing for Buenos Aires now in order to ensure that we have a clear and coherent strategy in place for COP 4. Mr Prescott's statement is a good first step on the way and demonstrates the Presidency's awareness of the need to make progress.</p>
<p class="contents">In conclusion, I hope that when we get to Buenos Aires the European Parliament's delegation will be closer to the heart of the EU delegation than at Kyoto because Parliament has an even more important role to play in environment policy in the future than it had in the past.</p>

<img align="absmiddle" alt="" src="/doceo/data/img/arrow_summary.gif"/>  <span class="doc_subtitle_level1_bis">Spencer </span> <span class="bold">(PPE).</span> – Mr President, can I start by thanking the Commissioner both for her statement today and for the kind words which she addressed to the members of GLOBE for our activities in Kyoto when she spoke to this Parliament in December.</p>
<p class="contents">Can I then turn to the President‐in‐Office and thank him for his statement and say that he places me, as a man who regards tradition as important, in an almost impossible position. The tradition to which I refer is, of course, the honourable Westminster tradition of seeking to oppose someone who is sitting opposite you. I find myself in the embarrassing position of being in almost full support of what you are doing on the climate change exercise. Indeed I see you very much as a kind of heavyweight John Gummer, ploughing the same furrows that John and the previous administration ploughed on this matter.</p>
<p class="contents">Let me however, just for the purpose of tradition, render you at least two moments of mild criticism, actually neither of them are mild. The first is to say that I share the considerable concern in my constituency over the confusion, to put it mildly, which has been felt in terms of this government's approach to the green belt. I represent Surrey, the county that invented green belts; this is an appallingly important issue to us and I would ask you in your domestic manifestation to make sure that if this concern is misplaced you get out there and reassure people rapidly.</p>
<p class="contents">Secondly, I would express some concern at the reversal of the previous government's push away from the use of coal and energy generation. It seems to me that the targets which we are going to have to set ourselves in reducing fossil fuel are so tough that any sign of weakness and moving away from the increased use of gas rather than coal is something that we will pay for in the future.</p>
<p class="contents">Having said that, can I return to the question of Kyoto. It was, as Ken Collins has indicated, something of a leaky bucket. I think there is a great deal of work to be done in the months that lie ahead particularly in ensuring that work in the subsidiary bodies of the convention takes place well before Kyoto. As you and I will recall from the early morning of Kyoto, there is a limit to what you can do in those last few hours of negotiations, if the work has not been done – the work on plugging the leaks, the work on sorting out how to talk to the developing world, the work on how to deal with, for instance, emissions trading.</p>
<p class="contents">I think emissions trading is going to be the most difficult issue for us all to cope with, because it is going to require a revolution in our mind‐sets. We, as Europeans, went into Kyoto as the ‚good guys’ determined to keep the target up as far as possible. The Americans engaged in a very cynical exercise and were determined to get emissions trading in place. I think that good emissions trading is worth having, but that means emissions trading that has a proper institutional framework and is subject to proper controls. None of that preparatory work is being done. We as a Union are the group in the world that has the most interest now in making sure that it is done. I wish you well and I look forward to your sustained interest in this, not just during the British Presidency, but during whatever months or years remain to the Labour government.</p>

 Mr President, ladies and gentlemen, I too would like to thank Madam Commissioner and the Council for taking the work of our Parliament into consideration. Undoubtedly, climate change has serious, destabilizing consequences for the entire planet and for the life of all living beings.</p>
<p class="contents">Recently, El Niño has led to an irregular overheating of the surface waters of the equatorial Pacific, the contrast between the hot water from the south and the cold from the north and very intense storms with exceptional winds. Real catastrophes have affected the Pacific coast, and waves 8‐9 metres high have lashed San Francisco. We should not forget that it is difficult to warn the populations in similar crises owing to the speed with which unforeseeable tornadoes arise.</p>
<p class="contents">It is therefore urgently necessary to achieve specific and more satisfactory results at global level with regard to a reduction in greenhouse gases and the overheating of the planet.</p>
<p class="contents">At the Kyoto Summit in December 1997, steps were taken in that direction, as the need for worldwide intervention was recognized. However, the Protocol contains results which, although they may be considered sufficient, are not satisfactory.</p>
<p class="contents">Several countries are still reticent over the need to reduce greenhouse gases. At this third conference, the Union reached a more binding agreement than the previous one, but ratification of the Kyoto Protocol by the Union should take place as a result of the progress recorded and on the basis of specific measures, before the next meeting in Buenos Aires in November 1998.</p>
<p class="contents">Parliament considers it important to record positive developments to achieve the objectives laid down on the parameters, principles and procedures, and considers it essential for the EU to continue to play a leading role in international negotiations to try and implement a common policy aimed at halting the current climate change.</p>
<p class="contents">Finally, it would be advisable for Parliament to send a larger delegation to Buenos Aires, noting the work carried out by other institutional and international bodies, such as the Africa, Caribbean and Pacific Assembly, which is formed of small insular states which are currently suffering from the harmful effects of the climate change.</p>

 Mr President, back in December we already expressed our appreciation for the role the Commission and the Council played during the negotiations in Kyoto, and we would like to reiterate this. But let us not be satisfied for too long about the results which were achieved during the negotiations. Now we really have to get to work. We are therefore anxiously awaiting the Commission"s document on the implementation of Kyoto. Six gases are more than the three we had in mind, after all. My question to the Commission is, when may we expect this document?</p>
<p class="contents">A guiding principle for this will have to be that the original negotiations of the European Union continue to be the starting point. The Commissioner said so himself: the stakes will have to be raised higher for Europe than those which were accepted in Kyoto. To reach these objectives for each country by means of burden sharing, extremely costly measures will be required, along with significant social efforts and technological breakthroughs.</p>
<p class="contents">The bills for the Netherlands, for example, show that ECU 10 billion will be needed, as well as a lowering of the maximum speed limit to 100 km/h, a doubling of taxes on petrol, and so on and so forth. Even then, in 2010 the emissions in our country can be expected to be 13 % above 1999 levels, whilst we need a decrease of 10 %. This is a difference of 23 %. Modal shifts in energy, expensive solutions to CO<span class="sub">2 </span>
in the soil, and a drastic increase in government expenditure in this area are vital. This incredibly heavy task is what we are presented with if we want to fulfil our promise.</p>

 Mr President, Madam Commissioner, in its communication at the end of last year the Commission – a leader at Kyoto – was already saying that there was a need for urgent and effective measures, and that it was economically and socially possible to reduce CO<span class="sub">2</span>
 emissions by 800 million tonnes by the year 2010, that is, by about 15 %.</p>
<p class="contents">It is true that since there are six greenhouse gases the percentage can vary. As Mr Eisma said, it is likely that we will need to have that study to hand. We also welcome the Commission communication on preserving biodiversity, and the fact that at Cardiff the Commissioner is going to defend the integration of environmental policy into all European policies. However, we believe it is all interrelated. If we cannot go to Argentina with another leading position in favour of a clear and transparent reduction of greenhouse gases; if, simultaneously, by the year 2000 we have not yet managed to put a clearly delimited Natura network in place; if we have not similarly put in place measures for the preservation of biodiversity; and, above all, if we are not able to include environmental measures in the EU"s other policies, then it will be very difficult to make progress in any of the envisaged objectives.</p>
<p class="contents">We are seeing day by day that in transport, agriculture and other sectors, measures are being taken which flagrantly conflict with the preservation of the environment. And day by day, in our own countries, we are also seeing the adoption of specific measures which go against our ultimate objective. So at Cardiff, I think the Commissioner – who is getting used to being forceful – should clearly, once and for all, fight for the European Union to include environmental measures in all European policies, so that it is not just a headline again, but is put into practice effectively.</p>

 Mr President, all the speakers, or nearly all of them, have noted the fact that, for the first time, we have a regulatory framework at international level, and I support this positive move.</p>
<p class="contents">Having said this, we must immediately put this into perspective with regard to the objective, which should be to stabilize the climate. The figures arrived at through consensus are really very limited. This is one more reason why we should be vigilant with regard to observing, examining and defining the factors which may constitute real loopholes in this regulatory framework. I am referring here to flexibility measures – trade in emission rights, carbon price evaluations – which are really difficult to quantify. It therefore falls to the Commission and the Council to play an active role in the follow‐up to these negotiations.</p>
<p class="contents">If we want the European Union to be credible, I believe that it is important to respect the objectives which have been set, and I do not see why – and this is the position of my group – we do not adopt the Commission"s declaration of last October as a starting point. In this it affirmed that we could easily achieve a 15 % reduction in emissions by the year 2010, with little economic cost, as long as adequate technologies and policies were used, and that It was even possible to achieve an economic profit.</p>
<p class="contents">On this basis, we consider that regulatory commitments must be immediately defined for Member States and that we should not content ourselves with a White Paper and recommendations intended for Member States but base ourselves on real directives. I believe that this is how we will become truly credible in the eyes of our international partners.</p>
<p class="contents">I would like to add that it is essential to include the restrictions which we want respected with regard to the Kyoto Protocol in international negotiations, beginning with the accession negotiations. I am thinking in particular of one large negotiation process, over which there is much question today: the Multilateral Agreement on Investment. There you can search in vain for any reference to this immense problem which we have been discussing here for the past few minutes.</p>

<img align="absmiddle" alt="" src="/doceo/data/img/arrow_summary.gif"/>  <span class="doc_subtitle_level1_bis">Weber </span> <span class="bold">(ARE).</span> – Mr President, ladies and gentlemen, firstly, I would remind the President‐in‐Office of the Council that the EU target in Kyoto was not 8 % but 15 %. It is important that the EU stick to its initial aim of 15 % reductions of greenhouse gases for the year 2010. This is both technically feasible and economically manageable. It all comes down to having the political will to act. These are not my words: I am quoting the Commission's official publication at Kyoto.</p>
<p class="contents">I would like to make some remarks about Article 3 of the Kyoto Protocol which deals with land use change, forestry and, specifically with afforestation, deforestation and reafforestation since 1990. By allowing those Annex B countries, for which land use change and forestry activity constituted a net source of greenhouse gas emissions in 1990, to include them in their 1990 emission basis for the purpose of calculating their assigned amount, the Kyoto Protocol opens up a considerable loophole. Paragraph 3 allows the use of afforestation and reafforestation as a means for carbon absorption to meet the commitments, and also deforestation is taken into account in a negative way.</p>
<p class="contents">What does this mean in practice? Countries that are actually converting their primary forest into plantations are encouraged to continue to do so. They are encouraged to replace primary forests by plantations of fast‐growing species in order to absorb the maximum of CO<span class="sub">2</span>
. This has certainly not enhanced the biodiversity of the areas concerned.</p>
<p class="contents">Which were the countries which made these requests? These were Australia, New Zealand, Canada and Russia. If these countries do not continue their deforestation, they will have an advantage because they will not need to make as much effort as other countries to achieve energy efficiency.</p>
<p class="contents">EU countries such as Finland and Austria which achieved net removals of CO<span class="sub">2</span>
 thanks to a sustainable forest use – in fact they cut less than the annual increment or growth – are disadvantaged by this system laid down in the Kyoto Protocol. When it comes to the clean development mechanism, Annex B countries could even, for instance, benefit from a project which they finance in the tropics, for example to convert primary forests into palm oil plantations – and we know what happened in Indonesia – while, at the same time, benefiting from the emissions at home.</p>
<p class="contents">To conclude, the Kyoto Protocol has many loopholes and is open to abuse. It needs to be amended. Let us use our right to amend it.</p>

 Mr President, I would like to add another thought to this debate on the European Union's future climate policy. Whenever we talk about targets for reducing emissions of greenhouse gases, we are asked how much it will cost. I think we need to turn that question on its head if we are to get any further. We need to ask what it will cost us if we do not reduce them. Then we will soon realise that reductions make very good economic sense.</p>
<p class="contents">With this in mind I would like to refer to paragraphs 8, 9, 10, 11 and 12 of the motion for resolution tabled by Mr Collins and Mrs Roth‐Berendt, which I regard as being particularly effective and positive here. I too fail to share the enthusiasm for emission trading – I actually think it is immoral. If we in the industrialized nations do not try to change and improve our structures, but simply plant replacement trees in the Third World or wherever, that is scarcely a constructive way forward.</p>
<p class="contents">I regard this as a modern version of trading in indulgences. Martin Luther nailed his Theses to the door of the church in Wittenberg as a protest against this sort of thing, back in 1517. We do not want a two‐class world in which one class is wasteful and is destroying the world and the other class lives on hand‐outs from the industrialized nations and gives up its own development. No, what we need is a sustainable, renewable economic system.</p>

 Mr President, ladies and gentlemen, I would like to remind Mr Kronberger that since Martin Luther's day another problem has come along. I am referring to the idea that anything printed on paper is automatically right. And that is the problem with Kyoto. At present we just have a paper agreement, because in practice energy consumption is growing in Europe as well, despite the warm winter. That is a fact. If we want to achieve the objective that we agreed to in Kyoto, then we will need to make an enormous effort, and go well beyond what we have assumed up to now. We will have to work against the grain of the market, at a time when the oil price is $14 a barrel.</p>
<p class="contents">Nor has it been resolved what we will do – and neither the Commissioner nor the President‐in‐Office has answered this point – if the United States refuse to sign the Kyoto agreement and to ratify it. Will we carry on pursuing these objectives in isolation or will we wait until they sign it? That is another question that needs answering.</p>
<p class="contents">The last main point that I want to make is this: if we take Kyoto seriously, that means the end of national energy policies. We are all jointly responsible now. From now on, none of the 15 Member States will be able to pursue a policy that goes against the main flow, certainly not on anything climate‐related. The next question is: are there any kinds of sanctions against countries or companies which do not respect these objectives? How will these objectives be implemented? How will all this be managed? What institutional framework do we need? The message that came out of Kyoto is that we need to develop a common energy strategy in Europe.</p>
<p class="contents">I would like to come back to a suggestion that I have already made several times: we need something along the lines of European climate management. I have in mind a climate agency with real executive power. Perhaps the Council or the Commission can comment on this.</p>

 Mr President, ladies and gentlemen, today, yet again, we meet to discuss climate change and what to do with the Kyoto agreements. Much has been said, and I for my part would like to emphasize three points.</p>
<p class="contents">Firstly, there needs to be rigorous verification of the data and methodology employed by countries and by Member States to arrive at the values they declare regarding their respective atmospheric emissions. A number of countries have recently reviewed their emission inventories and, interestingly, these reviews have invariably “benefited’ them in that the resulting values for emissions during the reference year of 1990 are higher than those that they had originally submitted. If each slice of the European cake is to grow, then there can be no doubt that the European bubble will swell like a soufflé in the oven.</p>
<p class="contents">Secondly, as regards policy and measures, internal measures and policies to reduce emissions in Europe must be formulated. Our energy, energy conservation and other programmes to date amount to no more than demonstrations of pilot programmes. A decisive impetus should be given to: the use of renewable fuels and to their sale and network connection; to practising resolute energy conservation and efficiency; to enhancing cogeneration facilities; to changing the system of taxation on energy consumption and pollution – as former President Jacques Delors proposed back in 1992; and to changing the way in which we use the transport sector by imposing new standards which reduce consumption and penalize motor vehicle pollution. We know what must be done; most of the requisite technology exists. It has not been done, purely and simply because governments have not wanted to.</p>
<p class="contents">Finally, the international negotiations which were decisively advanced in Kyoto must be continued. I will not dwell on this because others have already discussed the matter. I would like to support the President"s idea of carrying out an audit of the way in which each country is implementing its national programme for combating climate change and protecting the environment. We cannot accept that questions which were left unanswered in Kyoto, such as that of emissions trading, should be used as a means of avoiding in‐depth changes that may justifiably be demanded of those who use and consume energy, that is, we the people of Europe and those in the United States, who should consequently make the greatest effort.</p>

 Mr President, we thank the Commissioner and the President‐in‐Office of the Council for their statement on the implementation of the Kyoto Protocol, and the importance the Council Presidency wishes to attach to it. We agree that the Protocol will have to be signed as soon as possible, and subsequently ratified to put pressure on the United States and other partners. Ratification will not be possible, however, until the rules are worked out regarding the various systems and techniques, such as emission trading, evaluating sinks, defining clean development mechanisms, and so on.</p>
<p class="contents">The United States remained vague about this on purpose. The Commission must make proposals very soon, and prepare legislation, making sure that environment and energy policy are integrated, as well as agriculture and transport policy, because these policy areas are extremely intertwined. A link should also be made with the Fifth Framework Programme on Research and Development. The Union has constantly pointed out that the implementation of new technologies forms the basis of more efficient methods of production, and thus meets the principle of <span class="italic">no pain but gain</span>
. We wish to support the Commission and the Council in continuing to play the leading role, and to raise the stakes higher than was agreed in Kyoto.</p>

 Mr President, I think the joint motion contains the basic elements that are worth debating, and I therefore only want to mention three points.</p>
<p class="contents">Firstly, we must highlight the focus of the policy of development, aid, and so on, upon towns and cities, and what that means, namely alternative transport, communications and urban operations.</p>
<p class="contents">Secondly, we must consider the use of renewable energy sources. The target set by the resolution, 15 % of demand by 2010, is far too ambitious and to achieve it we would have to have made a start already. We have not done so.</p>
<p class="contents">Thirdly, we must look at alternative solutions for major transport and communications lines and the promotion of environmentfriendly means, such as trains. That too is absent from our policy, because our policy has two sides to it: one relates to taxation, the incorporation of its costs in the prices, and so on; and the other concerns our investment, the celebrated packages for cohesion, development, and many more.</p>
<p class="contents">Mr President, can the Commissioner give us an assurance that, for example in forthcoming packages for cohesion and development from 2000 onwards, conditions favourable to those three points will be included? And I am referring to alternative forms of transport and communications, concentration in the operation of urban centres and renewable energy sources.</p>

 Mr President, while we are discussing this, the climate is changing and is continuing to change day by day. Only the oil industry lobby seems to be unaware of this. But now is not the time for words, but for facts. And the facts say that, within the scope of the OECD countries, 1990 CO<span class="sub">2</span>
 emissions need to be reduced by 50 %. The EU"s objective has been 15 % by 2101. The result of the Kyoto agreement provides for 5 % during the period 2008‐2012, with many possible ways out and with countries not yet complying. We do not know what the real result will be.</p>
<p class="contents">I am therefore asking the President‐in‐Office of the Council and Commissioner Bjerregaard for the Union to unilaterally commit itself to 7.5 % by 2005, 15 % by 2010 and the establishment of a tax on CO<span class="sub">2, </span>
 to use tax incentives to favour processes involving uses of energy with low environmental impact.</p>
<p class="contents">It is therefore necessary for the decisions taken in Kyoto to become a directive, something binding. The choices made by the EU will be decisive to ensure that every man has the right to the fair and proper use of the atmosphere.</p>

 – Mr President, at the end of a conference, once the negotiations have been completed, but a good many outstanding remits still have to be tackled, the words of Brecht come to mind: ’After the struggle of the uphill climb comes the struggle over the plain’. I think that there are still a lot of struggles ahead of us, and the next stage of the journey, to Buenos Aires and beyond, will certainly be full of ups and downs. I believe that if the European Union is to be credible and to behave credibly, we need to do two things.</p>
<p class="contents">First, we will have to look outwards, to act in a global context, to make a contribution as a global player, just as we did in Kyoto. Second, we will have to make policies within the Union and put the necessary measures in place, with the Commission, the Council and this Parliament acting as a team.</p>
<p class="contents">We have already touched upon the legislative measures that will be needed, and I would like to highlight those. We need a legal base for implementing the European bubble, to get all the Member States to meet the obligations they have taken on and to monitor whether these obligations are being fulfilled. Furthermore, we need measures that will make it clear to the citizens of the Union that climate change affects every single person and that it involves perfectly simple things, such as how energy efficient their electrical goods are, what form of transport they choose and how waste is managed.</p>
<p class="contents">I believe that we will have to make specific, clear and verifiable proposals in the run‐up to Buenos Aires about how emission trading is to be managed and how the clean development fund will work. I also think that we as industrialized nations should shoulder these duties, especially when you consider that this development will give a boost to innovation, and the benefits of that will outweigh its cost.</p>

 Mr President, ladies and gentlemen, as I only have one minute's speaking time, I would like to address a few questions to the Council and the Commission. Do you really believe – this is a question to the Council and the Commission – that the weak compromise struck at the climate conference can really reverse the climate change already taking place? I personally think not.</p>
<p class="contents">Do you not think that in view of the very desirable industrialization of developing countries, there will be an increase in gas emissions even if we achieve the objectives of the Kyoto conference? Should we not, as honest politicians, clearly tell our people that it will probably be impossible to halt climate change? The most we can hope for is to stabilize present levels; I do not believe that it will be possible to go back.</p>
<p class="contents">Do you not think that we should face up to the consequences of this development, rather than present our citizens with an illusion that cannot become reality?</p>

<img align="absmiddle" alt="" src="/doceo/data/img/arrow_summary.gif"/>  <span class="doc_subtitle_level1_bis">Simpson </span> <span class="bold">(PSE).</span> – Mr President, can I thank the President‐in‐Office for his statement in the House today. The importance of environmental issues in the European Union is highlighted by the keen interest that there is throughout the Union, particularly amongst young people. I was delighted to hear the priority put on transport within the environment by the President‐in‐Office, and it is in this area that I want to make some comments this afternoon.</p>
<p class="contents">The effects of road transport on emissions and air quality are well documented. There is a need to encourage modal shifts towards a more environmentally‐sustainable method of transport in both passengers and freight. This goal can be achieved through measures which encourage public transport and promote a fundamental shift of freight from road to other modes such as rail, inland waterways and coastal shipping. These are modes of transport that are presently under‐utilized within the European Union but which are crucial if we are to hit our targets agreed at Kyoto and referred to by the President‐in‐Office.</p>
<p class="contents">That is our challenge. It is imperative that all three institutions within this Union work together to bring about the changes that we all desire. It is also imperative that within the transport sector we all work together to integrate our transport system so that a credible, safe and efficient alternative is offered to the use of private cars and lorries. But we must, as the President‐in‐Office said today, become more cross‐sectorial in our planning and thinking. Transport, environment and planning are all connected and need to work together. For far too long, both at national and European level, each area has followed its own ideals; this has lead to an uncoordinated approach to what is a very real problem.</p>
<p class="contents">We must also, as Mr Collins said, ensure that transport and the environment figure highly in our future policy‐making decisions. I appreciate that the EMU and enlargement are important subjects, but in order to enlarge the EU and to spend the ECU in it you have to have a continent with a clean environment in the first place. I am sure most MEPs, even those from Surrey, would welcome the start made by Kyoto. We must now show the political courage to carry on the fight and secure the future not only for ourselves, but more importantly, for our young people.</p>

<img align="absmiddle" alt="" src="/doceo/data/img/arrow_summary.gif"/>  <span class="doc_subtitle_level1_bis">Pollack </span> <span class="bold">(PSE).</span> – Mr President, I would like to thank the President‐in‐Office and the Commissioner for their very sterling efforts at Kyoto which were instrumental in brokering an agreement and show the strength of collective bargaining.</p>
<p class="contents">We are all conscious of the very difficult path to ratification of the Kyoto agreement and the very great efforts we need to make in Europe in order to meet our targets. At the same time we know that this is only the beginning of efforts to arrest the greenhouse effect worldwide.</p>
<p class="contents">The development of a new set of detailed policies and measures by the Commission is now essential and urgent, particularly in light of the news that EU emissions of CO<span class="sub">2</span>
 are on a rising curve. We also know that the loopholes and ambiguities left over from Kyoto will require intensive further negotiation in the run‐up to COP 4 at Buenos Aires: how to implement emissions trading, for example. We have a responsibility to use our strong European position to help some of the G−77 countries and China to develop clean energy. It must be done in a manner which could act as an incentive to them. This is where partnership with industry is essential, using European external policy to support and steer clean technology investment in the right areas. In this context, the inclusion of climate change on the agenda for the ASEM summit is very important and, in particular, the European Union's tropical forest strategy must be closely coordinated with the post‐Kyoto strategy to ensure maximum efficiency.</p>
<p class="contents">Finally the President‐in‐Office spoke of breaking out of the habit of thinking in a fragmented way. I would like to see closer integration of policies. For instance, it is crucial that, for the long‐term success of the battle against climate change, a strong environment protection clause is inserted into the Multilateral Agreement on Investment.</p>
<p class="contents">This has had to be a very compressed contribution because of lack of time, but I do urge the Council and Commission to take on board the numerous points in Parliament's resolution.</p>

It is appreciated. The word for today obviously is ‚integration’ and the European Parliament itself should do more to integrate the work of the different committees. I speak about energy. The world of energy is a tough and a nasty world full of vested interests with massive lobbying powers. But most individual decisions are made in energy.</p>
<p class="contents">In the United Kingdom last year 33 % of energy went on transport and 30 % on energy in the domestic sector, mainly space heating. Those are decisions which can be made by individuals. The EU has heavy responsibilities but weak powers and that is a reproach to the Member States who have not given it the tools for the job it should be able to do.</p>
<p class="contents">We have to do two things in the energy field. We have to use energy more rationally and we have to switch to renewable sources of energy. Let me give you a test of seriousness. If you are serious, you will ensure that the rational planning directive, which enables domestic customers to make sensible choices about their use of energy, is passed and rescued from the black hole it appears to have fallen into. You will put more money into the SAVE II programme and you will help the Fifth Framework Programme.</p>
<p class="contents">If you are serious about renewable energy, you will ensure that there is a legal base so that the European Union can do for renewable energy in 1997 what it did for nuclear energy in 1957. A treaty similar to the Euratom Treaty would enable us to do something meaningful in terms of renewable energy. We also need to look at ways in which that energy can have access to the grid.</p>
<p class="contents">Most of the things that will happen in response to Kyoto will not happen at our level but at Member State level. You will have our support in this Parliament for those few things we can do up to the end of the British Presidency and beyond. It is far too important to leave when we made such a good start at Kyoto.</p>

. – Mr President, I thank the honourable lady for her final remarks of support, which are very much appreciated, as indeed are those from all the honourable Members today.</p>
<p class="contents">It has been an excellent debate. It has expressed all the concerns we all feel about the Kyoto agreement, but there has been much agreement on these matters. Indeed, the many steps we have taken have been agreed with. It is important for us to bear in mind that Europe has to keep the lead. It has an opportunity to do so. It has set the lead in this matter and we must sustain that, as it is absolutely crucial we get agreement on these measures to get the climate changes that are necessary.</p>
<p class="contents">Nobody has thrown any doubt on the science before us on these matters. In America there is a great deal of debate about that, but in the rest of the world the science is absolutely clear, and this is being accepted more in America of late.</p>
<p class="contents">I welcome the resolution before us – that seems to touch many of the issues – and the calls for integration, which I mentioned in my speech today. Many honourable Members have pointed out that Kyoto was the first step, and indeed that is my approach to it. Without ratification of this agreement it will not mean a great deal, and it is important that we achieve that ratification.</p>
<p class="contents">The next stages are absolutely important. We need agreement on the flexibilities, the sinks, the joint implementation and all the measures that Members have referred to. But be in no doubt about it, if we do not get agreement on those rules, there will be no ratification.</p>
<p class="contents">Everybody has a veto in this process. If you look at the terms for ratification – 55 countries or 55 % of gas emissions – we can all play the veto game if we want. In reality, what is most welcome about the Kyoto agreement was the fact that we got an agreement at all! We have to have the same approach to ratification. The forces in America make it clear that if the developing countries do not sign up to the process, they will not ratify it. The period of time between now and ratification may be as much as three or four years, because, in my judgement, the ratification process will not take place in America until after the next American elections. So there is some time for us to work out these rules.</p>
<p class="contents">I hear people say that this was perhaps a weak agreement or ask why we did not necessarily keep to the 15 %. But I do not think you would have thanked us if we had come back to this House and said that we had got 15 % but nobody else would sign up for it so we had not got an agreement. Agreement is about reaching agreement with other countries in this matter and on an issue in which there was not to be a vote on matters of division because it required consensus.</p>
<p class="contents">I should put on record the tremendous debt we owe to Ambassador Strada who got everybody under these circumstances to come to some agreement, which right up to the last minute was often in doubt. It was his particular skills that played a major part in finding an agreement for this first step. We got a good agreement and the NGOs themselves think it is an agreement far better than they expected.</p>
<p class="contents">Of course it is a first step. But it will mean nothing unless we get ratification, and ratification, again, requires us to enter into a process of difficult and complex negotiations, negotiations that now involve deciding the rules to apply to the modalities. We are clear, and America must understand also, that all these issues in determining the rules concerning the modalities have to be agreed by all countries or ratification of the Treaty will not be achieved. Therefore, we are setting out our position ready for Buenos Aires, showing exactly where we stand, how we can get an agreement and using all our abilities to achieve those agreements.</p>
<p class="contents">When it is said to me: what if they do not ratify nationally? Well that will be a disaster for the world, the global economy and the global environment. Nevertheless, bear in mind that the question was often posed in our negotiations. What if, in fact, certain countries in the European bubble do not agree to the targets set for them? What will we do with those countries? There are no identifiable sanctions.</p>
<p class="contents">When I hear the honourable Member from Luxembourg saying that in his view we should have kept to the 15 % aim, well there is nothing to stop Luxembourg from doing what my country is doing. We have set 15 %; indeed, we have set 20 % on the reduction of CO<span class="sub">2</span>
 gases. This is only a minimum. There is no reason why a country cannot set higher standards if it so wishes. What we are establishing here is a minimum understanding under the bubble.</p>
<p class="contents">I know Luxembourg was good in achieving its target, as indeed was Britain. But that meant we closed most of our coal industry down and Luxembourg closed down one steel industry. There are different consequences in different countries. Perhaps Luxembourg might be able to increase the price of the cheap petrol it sells there as another contribution to reducing greenhouse gases. We all make our contributions in different ways and there is nothing to prevent higher standards being set in these matters.</p>
<p class="contents">This gives me the opportunity to point out that when we take certain measures to achieve the overall agreements, sometimes the pain is greater in some of our communities than others. In the pit communities in Britain, where the only means of employment has been torn out, the community is dying. Therefore we have a responsibility to help those countries which have paid a price for the judgement of the coal industry. In Britain they have paid a heavy price which we must seek to adjust, and that is not only applicable to the coal industry.</p>
<p class="contents">Mr Simpson made a point basically about our domestic economy and my own government's policies in regard to greenbelt. Whilst we have only been in nine months – and I cannot resist saying this – there are now more areas of greenbelt than when we came to power. Indeed, today we have announced an increase of 12 500 hectares of greenbelt around Durham. That is a substantial step forward. But, as he knows, I shall be making a statement to the House of Commons shortly about that matter. We think greenbelt is an important area.</p>
<p class="contents">Transport also has a major role to play, there is no doubt about that. We see the importance of the contribution of transport to the environment and the need to question the role of the car in our cities. We must seek to use public transport more than private vehicles and to try to get more goods moved from road to rail. Indeed our own environmental policies and the White Paper in my own country will seek to achieve that. This has been a very good debate dealing with the essential issues. There have been calls for action for taking Kyoto forward. I would say that we have already spelt out, certainly for the next six months, a programme for action.</p>
<p class="contents">Several Members have told us not to rest on our laurels. I do not think any of us want to. Let me remind the House of the objectives we have set ourselves, which have been agreed between the Council and the Commission and in discussion with this Parliament. By June we hope to reach a common position on updating the CO<span class="sub">2</span>
 monitoring mechanisms. By June we want to see an agreed burden‐sharing for the 8 %. By June we will agree the first tranche of European measures such as reducing CO<span class="sub">2 </span>
emissions from cars. By June we want the Community and the Member States to have signed the Protocol. By June we will have a common European position for the official negotiations in Bonn on trading and other issues.</p>
<p class="contents">This is an ambitious programme for the next four months. It answers some of the queries that have been posed by the honourable Members about the coming few months following on from Kyoto. It is a programme that keeps Europe to the fore in putting across the case, in extending the negotiations that follow on from Kyoto, and in establishing the policies that are necessary to achieve those objectives. We have every reason to be proud of our record. We have a programme that will sustain Europe to the fore in these matters and which I hope will satisfy this House in the future.</p>

 Mr President, I am also pleased at the debate we have had today, and I feel that we have been given an enormous impetus which can be used in further work. Mr Eisma had a question, which I think John Prescott has actually answered already, but I will try and answer it too. It was about the communication which is, so to speak, a follow‐up to the communication of October, and which deals with the situation since Kyoto. This communication covers six gases instead of three, and we expect to have it ready for discussion at the Council meeting in June, which means it can also be put on Parliament's agenda before the summer recess, if Parliament can do this. In other words, we expect to deal with this communication energetically, and I can confidently state that some of the resources mentioned here today will be used in the process, as they were also included in the previous communication – not least the comments made on energy as a whole.</p>
<p class="contents">I would like to emphasize once again that it is not immediately possible to transfer the goals we had before Kyoto or the annual figures we were working with. The agreement now covers six gases, and six gases is not the same as three, so the goals cannot simply be transferred. So far, we have seen a number of different calculations at DG XI, and the latest I have seen – although this could well change given the way the work is going – refer to 12 % instead of 15 %, and so the question is, of course, whether to go beyond the 8 % which was agreed or to leave it at 8 %. But 15 % is not something which can be used in further discussions in any case.</p>
<p class="contents">I would also like to emphasize – and Mr Tamino also had some remarks on this point – that the Commission has been in absolutely no doubt that taxes are a useful tool. There are proposals on the table which the Council can take up. We all now know what happened to the CO<span class="sub">2</span>
 emission tax. It is still there and it could be taken up. In other words, if the will were there, it would be quite possible to use this tool.</p>
<p class="contents">I would like to finish by saying that, like John Prescott, I am pleased that the overwhelming majority of speakers here today have recognised the results achieved at Kyoto. There is no doubt that we would have liked to have had higher targets, but it would have been totally pointless if there had only been European targets and no targets covering the countries we are comparing ourselves with – mainly Japan and the US. Of course, such targets will not be achieved without negotiation and without the will to fight for our own targets. I would put it like this: I think we have a result which is a good starting point, but which is definitely not the end of the road. I am pleased that the Presidency has emphasized so clearly today that we have a great deal of work ahead of us. Both the Presidency and the Commission are prepared to help with this work.</p>

 Mr President, Madam Commissioner, we need clean air in Europe. It is the cornerstone for quality of life and environmental quality in Europe, and it is a European issue, because pollution knows no borders. It is not a question of individual interests or of minority interests, and is not an issue between left and right in the political sense. Nor is it a question of national interests. No, it is in the interests of all the citizens of Europe: the quality of their life is at stake, which means that as Members of the European Parliament we have to deal with this issue at European level.</p>
<p class="contents">We know that there are currently 200 million cars in the European Union. We know that the car will be the key to our mobility for the foreseeable future. Now, some people think that the best exhaust gas purification system is the human lung. I say no, we must make the car as environmentally friendly as possible. We need to give the green light. The facts are clear to see. On the one hand we have increasing traffic levels. Although individual cars have become cleaner since 1970 – not voluntarily by the way, but because of our legislation – everyone uses these cars more, so that any benefit is cancelled out. Ozone levels are rising and traffic causes cardio‐vascular disorders, asthmatic conditions, especially in children, and there are lung complaints caused by particles in emissions and the acidification of the environment. On the other hand, there are solutions to these problems. These are underpinned by the legendary Auto‐Oil programme. I say legendary because the history of this since 1993 is indeed the stuff of legends, which is a sign of how much time this discussion has taken. If anyone says to me that we need a second Auto‐Oil programme, I just say: ’Look how long it took to achieve anything last time. Let us get this one right before we start anything else’. We should not abandon the approach adopted in the Auto‐Oil programme, because it represents a reasonable and integrated approach. It is not just a matter of tightening the screw wherever it is technically possible, but of looking at the best way to reduce emissions, be it through fuels, engine technology or traffic management measures.</p>
<p class="contents">So there are solutions, and this Parliament noted at first reading that there were some shortcomings in the Commission proposal, which was based on the Auto‐Oil study. In fact, the Council accepted that some of these shortcomings existed and took Parliament's suggestions on board. For example, the Council made cold‐start tests for vehicles a requirement for type‐approval. It does not make much sense if a car has marvellous exhaust gas values at 20°C if you think about starting it in the morning, remembering that an average temperature of 20°C is found in very few areas of Europe; it therefore makes sense to consider a vehicle's exhaust emissions at low temperatures.</p>
<p class="contents">However, we want more, and for very good reasons. We want fuel‐related improvements. Recent studies have shown that fuel quality has a direct impact on air quality. London Transport carried out a study which showed that identical buses, without any technical modifications, will emit less sulphur, 40 % less hydrocarbons and 40 % less soot particles, just by using better fuel.</p>
<p class="contents">How can anyone who knows cities like Madrid, Lisbon, Athens, Frankfurt or London say that we do not want better fuels, although we know that this is a way to reduce particulate emissions? We also need better fuels for technological development in the future. Sulphur is in fact a killer for catalytic converters, and if we want better exhaust gas standards by 2005, then we need better fuel. All studies into the effectiveness and durability of catalytic converters indicate this. So we must do something about fuels.</p>
<p class="contents">However, we also need to do something more about the cars themselves. The Commission has proposed indicative limit values for 2005. We say that there is sufficient data to prescribe mandatory limit values now, and this would give the industry enough time to push ahead with development. A large part of the European automotive industry has in fact already said: ’We are not ecstatic, but we could live with mandatory limit values for 2005’. So we should go for a clear position here.</p>
<p class="contents">A second important aspect regarding automotive technology is that practical considerations are important. It is not actually possible to push emission limit values down to zero. We will never see the day when the air that comes out at the back is better than the air going in at the front. But we must ensure that a car not only has good emission limit values at the type‐approval stage, but that these are maintained in practice. That is why we want a reasonable, unbureaucratic system of road‐side testing; we want Member States to have the right to check suspect vehicles. Mr Car, can you still boast the same emission values you had three years ago? And if not, why not?</p>
<p class="contents">We also want to introduce an on‐board diagnostics system which allows constant monitoring of exhaust gas values and checks for malfunctions. In addition, we want to allow independent workshops and automobile clubs to maintain and repair vehicles, and to allow independent manufacturers to produce spare parts. The automotive industry is always telling me that will involve giving away all kinds of technical secrets. That is not what this is about. It is just a matter of releasing the information needed to carry out repairs. Some people agree, but it is all covered by block exemptions. My response to that, especially in view of recent debates, is that when it comes to the future of block exemptions I only have to remember the fine imposed on Volkswagen and the way that company treated its dealers. Give me reasonable legislation rather than an exempting regulation any day!</p>
<p class="contents">Light commercial vehicles' engines are of course based on car engines. The technology is similar, and so I believe that they are an integral part of this. I would have preferred if we could have treated both as a single package from the outset. We tried to integrate things somewhat, and in particular we tried to make the limit values for 2005 mandatory for light commercial vehicles as well. The European Parliament does not just want more, it also wants a little less, it wants a clear‐out. There is a durability test in which a car does 80 000 kilometres on the test bench. No car has ever failed it, and we want to get rid of this test.</p>
<p class="contents">This legislation helps employment, because European manufacturers will gain some competitive advantages. Discussions in Japan and in the USA are still going on of course. This new technology is creating and preserving jobs, and whole new industries are emerging. The catalytic converter industry has created 15, 000 new jobs over the last 10 years – it did not even exist before that. Of course there are some people who want to put the brakes on. The lobbyists are busy at work in the corridors here, especially the ones who work for the European oil industry. Sometimes I feel like getting out my hat and collecting money for the poor oil industry. No, that is not acceptable: we need constructive dialogue, and just saying no will achieve nothing. Our experience with <span class="italic">Brent Spar</span>
 has shown that constructive dialogue with us is needed, not just saying ‚nyet’ all the time.</p>
<p class="contents">There are many others who support our proposals, including all the motoring organizations, such as Germany's ADAC. The proposals are supported by 40 million car users, because they want clean, environmentally friendly cars. So I am convinced that this Parliament will stand up to those who want to put the brakes on, ignore their campaigning and pass the Elk Test without turning over!</p>

 Mr President, I wish to thank all my colleagues for the splendid level of cooperation they have shown in this matter, which really concerns two main issues: standards for vehicle emissions, and fuel quality. This huge undertaking has been mine since Mr Mamère was elected to the French parliament.</p>
<p class="contents">In the EU, 40 000 people die prematurely every year from air pollution, according to the WHO. Awareness of this health hazard has only grown in recent times. That is why I believe we have a still firmer basis for discussing progressively structured goals for fuel quality than we did last spring, when Parliament first made its position clear.</p>
<p class="contents">The biggest problems are particle emissions, nitrogen oxides and hydrocarbons. To bring levels down we need cleaner fuels, especially with so many old cars on the road. Furthermore, there are a lot of diesel‐powered vehicles in many EU countries, once considered economical, but which have now proved to be particularly dangerous for people"s health.</p>
<p class="contents">I have been delighted to see that health organizations have recently been very active in areas relating to the Auto‐Oil programme. Motoring organizations have also been active, because they know that, although we need cars, if the emissions are not cleaned up, opposition to cars on the road is likely to grow still greater.</p>
<p class="contents">Much has been argued about who is going to pay for these proposed changes, and how much. I am fully convinced that the oil industry has given us over‐estimated figures for investment. There is no way we are going to need ECU 60 billion over a period of ten years, and we have now referred the matter to the Arthur D. Little consultancy agency, for further investigation. There they corrected the consultant"s previous figures and stated that their costs of making fuel cleaner were, for example, in terms of risk to health, 55 % too high and, as regards regular petrol, as much as 17 % too high.</p>
<p class="contents">Naturally, there is need for investment, and the oil industry is the one sector in Europe that has not invested a great deal in new technology in the last few decades. But it is not fair to ignore environmental concerns, just because the industry is in trouble. Actually, the oil industry runs at 120 % capacity. It is inevitable that we shall in any case have to close some refineries for structural reasons. But it is certainly now reasonable to invest in cleaner production technology. Apart from for the oil industry this is important for the car industry which is, in an indirect way, the biggest end user of these products. The car industry is convinced that cleaner fuels must be on the market everywhere in Europe by the year 2005.</p>
<p class="contents">If we look at costs to the motorist, then I trust the figures which show that the added cost for a normal petrol‐driven car will be about ECU 5 a year. As for diesel car owners the cost will work out at perhaps twice this cost, or about ECU 10 a year. Some countries have derived great benefit from differential tax incentives. In this way, the state has, in a manner of speaking, met industry halfway. It has become clear that these products can be made more attractive through tax relief to the consumer when repayment periods for investment are also shortened.</p>
<p class="contents">As for my proposals, the Council of Ministers placed constrictions on the Commission"s proposals last April, and so I will not be suggesting limitation values for the year 2000 either, as it is too soon. Instead, I believe it is essential that the limitation values prescribed for the year 2005 are binding, and not meant as guidelines, as the Commission and Council of Ministers propose.</p>

 Mr President, ladies and gentlemen, our job is to set targets and monitor deviations from them. With Euro II we set targets worth aspiring to. And of course Euro III, which is now before us, contains ambitious objectives which are well worth working towards.</p>
<p class="contents">Of course, in adopting the exhaust gas legislation under Euro III it will be necessary to take account of the integrated approach of the Auto‐Oil programme so that the emission limit values can actually be achieved. This is the only way to realize the objective of improving air quality in European centres of population. While I fully appreciate the importance of the environment, we should not go too far, particularly at a time of mass unemployment all over Europe. The automotive and oil industries are key players in our economies, as we all realize, so we should strive to reach a solution together with those affected.</p>
<p class="contents">You cannot make securing jobs and creating new ones a priority one day and then go all out for environmental objectives the next. We have to try to prevent the scales tipping too far either way, as in either case it will cause damage. But I am confident that if we implement the measures planned intelligently, we can, as it were, combine business with pleasure: by pleasure I mean improving the quality of life of our fellow citizens; by business I mean encouraging the automobile and oil industries to make investments which will simultaneously improve their competitiveness, help the environment and create new jobs.</p>

 Mr President, ladies and gentlemen, the Commission would like to take this opportunity to thank the Committee on the Environment and Mr Lange and Mrs Hautala, the rapporteurs, as well as Mr Rübig, for their work on these three proposals which are clearly aimed at making a considerable improvement in air quality in Europe and hence also improving Europeans' quality of life. As the initial negotiations made clear, these are highly comprehensive and highly significant proposals. We are now on the second round of negotiations, and as you know, the Council approved the two joint reports unanimously.</p>
<p class="contents">The Council recognised that the Commission's approach was sound, and some of the main elements of the joint approaches are as follows: that cost‐effectiveness be used as a criteria for choosing the best solutions for achieving the environmental targets; that fuel standards be tightened up from the year 2000; and that guideline standards be laid down for fuel in the year 2005. The binding values for 2005 will be set after examining the current and future technological developments in Auto‐Oil 2. The results of this examination, involving the Commission, experts from the Member States, NGOs and industry in an active, highly transparent process, will be available by mid−1999 and so I will of course be happy to discuss these proposals with Parliament in the second half of next year.</p>
<p class="contents">The Commission's attitude towards the amendments will be discussed in more detail by my colleagues Martin Bangemann and Christos Papoutsis. One thing I would like to emphasize about these initial remarks is that the Commission has great sympathy for the wishes for environmental improvements behind Parliament's improvements. It is precisely the dramatic developments in the number of cars which makes it urgently necessary for us to consider the environmental effects, and air quality is of course a vital issue in this respect. But it is also clear that the Commission must stand by the principles on which its proposals are based. The aim of the Auto‐Oil programme is to improve the air quality in our cities and we are basing this on environmental and health considerations. The provisional air quality standards on which the Auto‐Oil programme is based have since been confirmed in the directive on air quality standards for nitrous oxides, particles, and so on. I will be happy to discuss this with Parliament, hopefully in May.</p>
<p class="contents">Work on these proposals has also confirmed that the air quality standards used as the basis for the Auto‐Oil programme are in accordance with a high level of protection and the latest guidelines of the World Health Organization. When the standards were established, the Auto‐Oil programme was designed to meet them as cheaply as possible, which is why the proposals are also based on cost‐effectiveness.</p>
<p class="contents">Let me emphasize that, the way I see it, we are agreed on a high level of environmental protection and that we should achieve this. The methods of achieving this level must of course be systematic, they must be transparent and they must involve as little cost as possible. I do not think that we are not agreement as regards the goal, but perhaps we disagree on how to achieve it. The year 2000 is not far off, and so I would like to see these proposals passed as soon as possible. Industry needs clear signals in good time, and needs a clear framework within which to plan and meet its obligations.</p>
<p class="contents">I hope these brief remarks have clarified the background to the Commission's approach and I also hope this opens the way to approving the right proposals.</p>

 Mr President, there can be no doubt that the rapporteurs and their colleagues in Parliament's committees have once again worked very hard. We have already had an opportunity to exchange views between the first decision and today's debate. But we must not kid ourselves. Our discussions today will probably not lead to any change in Parliament's position.</p>
<p class="contents">It seems likely that tomorrow Parliament will once again vote for the same amendments which it introduced at first reading, as they are essentially the same. And we do not need a crystal ball to predict that the Council will once again reject these amendments. This in itself demonstrates the difficulties faced by the Council with both reports debated here, in trying to reach a common position; but it also demonstrates the unanimity which was finally achieved.</p>
<p class="contents">I am sure I am right in saying that today we must look beyond this reading and the Council decision to the conciliation procedure that will probably be necessary. I am quite happy to read from my brief and tell you why the Commission will have to reject the same amendments it could not accept at first reading. That goes to show how enduring our powers of reasoning are, they can resist even the best arguments!</p>
<p class="contents"><span class="italic"><span class="italic">(Laughter)</span> </span></p>
<p class="contents">I would therefore like to make two basic comments. First, although we may agree on principles, we still seem to find it difficult, when it comes to converting these principles into specific proposals, to recognize what is in accordance with a given principle and what is not, otherwise we would not argue so much. After all, the principles and the methodology which emerged from the first Auto‐Oil programme were accepted by all the EU institutions. Even Parliament welcomed them, and we found that encouraging, because we thought there was now more common ground between us as a basis for further progress. But there is evidently such a great gap between principle and detail that it is still difficult to reach agreement on such matters. Mr Lange has once again suggested that he has carried these principles over from the Auto‐Oil I, while we think that those principles would not justify the amendments that he has tabled once again.</p>
<p class="contents">I would therefore venture to propose the following: we can accept six of the amendments and another six in principle. However, they are the same amendments we accepted at first reading. To be precise I will give you the numbers: 4, 11, 49, 50, 51 and 53 are completely acceptable, and 5, 9, 15, 31, 54 and 69 partly so. We cannot accept the remainder. So we shall meet again, and I hope, especially in the light of the Council's position, which will probably be the same, that we will be able to reach some agreement during the conciliation process, because we need a decision, come what may. If we cannot get a decision or if it the response is “no’, which cannot be ruled out in conciliation, none of us will have done ourselves any favours, and no‐one could be proud about that.</p>
<p class="contents">However, it is not my intention to discourage you before the vote tomorrow. I understand that the first President of Federal Germany was a committed civilian and therefore had some difficulties with the military, but as President he was of course nevertheless also responsible for that aspect of public life. He concluded his first visit to the army with the following words, which were not very warmly received: ’Well, have a great victory!’. That was held against him for a long time, because it showed he did not really understand those people. I am mentioning this, because if I exhort you with the words ‚Well, have a great vote!’. I do not want to fall into the same trap!</p>

<img align="absmiddle" alt="" src="/doceo/data/img/arrow_summary.gif"/>  <span class="doc_subtitle_level1_bis">Papoutsis, </span> <span class="italic">Member of the Commission. – (EL)</span>
 Mr President, ladies and gentlemen, first of all I would like to thank the rapporteurs, and in particular Mrs Hautala for her detailed report.</p>
<p class="contents">In the context of the common position adopted by the Council, it is envisaged that already from the first six months of 1999 the Commission will submit a proposal defining compulsory specifications for fuels, scheduled to come into force in 2005. For that reason, the Commission cannot accept from now compulsory specifications for 2005 without the essential scientific backing. From the first six months of next year and on the basis of the Auto‐Oil II Programme, we will have the necessary additional information on technical questions concerning the subject, and will then be able to reach a well‐founded decision about the approved fuel standards to be in use after 2005. The Commission therefore considers it premature to define compulsory fuel standards now, to become applicable in 2005.</p>
<p class="contents">The specific problems can be tackled in other ways: the common position allows Member States to use special fuels where appropriate, in response to specific problems connected with the quality of the atmospheric environment in certain areas, especially in large cities. The characteristics of the special fuels will of course be dictated, depending on the case, by the nature of the special atmosphere quality problems of the specific areas in which these fuels will probably have to be used.</p>
<p class="contents">The Commission also recognises that tax incentives are a very strong way to encourage the market promotion and use of cleaner fuels.</p>
<p class="contents">The European Community already possesses a framework within which Member States can modify the levels of the special taxes levied on special consumer fuels to serve the aims of environmental protection. Indeed, granted that Community measures already exist that concern tax interventions for fuels, the Commission believes that it is useful to reiterate the orders in question in a further directive.</p>
<p class="contents">Today's common position also provides for a ban on the sale of leaded petrol on the market. That measure is justified because lead in petrol is the most serious source of lead pollution. Already, since the middle of the 1980s, Directive 85/210/EEC has required Member States to encourage the use of unleaded petrol. Consequently, the Commission considers that the sale of leaded petrol within the Community should be banned after the year 2000. However, the Commission recognizes that because of the existing large fleet of vehicles, such a ban would probably create serious social and economic problems in some Member States, and we therefore support the temporary deferment allowed for in the Council's common position, so that some Member States will have a certain leeway in time to put the requisite changes into effect.</p>
<p class="contents">Community specifications on the quality of atmospheric air are based on the maintenance of high standards both for health reasons and to protect the environment. I want to assure you here that the Commission will take care to incorporate that principle in its future proposals as well.</p>
<p class="contents">Mr President, ladies and gentlemen, the Commission can accept a number of amendments which improve the Council's common position without modifying its basic philosophy. I am referring to Amendments Nos 11, 13, the second part of No 14, 17, the third and fourth parts of No 23 and the first part of No 24.</p>
<p class="contents">The Commission can also accept Amendment No 6 subject to the condition, however, that the following sentence is added at the end: ’... provided that certain specifications do not fall below or exceed particular levels’.</p>
<p class="contents">However, the Commission cannot accept the other amendments. Let me explain why. Amendments Nos 3, 4, 5 and the first part of No 23 conflict with the criterion of cost‐effectiveness as a basis for the legislation, despite the fact that this criterion is established by Directive 94/12/EEC.</p>
<p class="contents">Amendment No 127, the fourth part of No 15, and Amendments Nos 25 to 29 propose measures which have been shown not to be cost‐effective on the basis of the Auto‐Oil I Programme.</p>
<p class="contents">Amendment No 1, the first parts of Nos 14, 15 and 16, No 19, the second part of No 23 and Amendments Nos 30 to 37 are incompatible with the Auto‐Oil programme's methodology, with which we will be able, in the middle of 1999, to examine and propose economically advantageous measures to take effect in 2005.</p>
<p class="contents">Amendments Nos 8, 9, 18, 28 and 39 do not take into account the provisions of Directive 92/81/EEC and the Commission's more recent proposal with code number COM(97)0030 on the use of tax incentives for fuels.</p>
<p class="contents">The seventh part of Amendment No 15, Amendments Nos 20, 21 and 22 and the second part of No 24 also do not comply with established procedures.</p>
<p class="contents">The third and fifth parts of Amendment No 15 do not take sufficient account of particular national, regional or even local situations.</p>
<p class="contents">Amendments Nos 2, 10 and 12, the second and sixth parts of No 15 and the second part of No 16 deal with details and require further technical examination.</p>
<p class="contents">However, the Commission recognizes that during the examination of the common position, Parliament has proposed particularly interesting ideas. I want to assure you that one way or the other, your proposals will receive further consideration during the preparation of proposals for future directives.</p>

<img align="absmiddle" alt="" src="/doceo/data/img/arrow_summary.gif"/>  <span class="doc_subtitle_level1_bis">Bowe </span> <span class="bold">(PSE).</span> – Mr President, in ten years time – and it will take ten years – far fewer European children will be suffering from asthma caused by car fumes if we meet the targets of the Auto‐Oil Programme. Towns as far apart as Aberdeen in the north of Scotland and Athens in Greece will be better, cleaner and healthier places in which to bring up children, to live and to work. That should be our admirable objective today.</p>
<p class="contents">We must all play our part in achieving the results of the Commission's Auto‐Oil proposals. Those results are just the beginning, the Commission's proposals are just the first step in a process that will take ten years. We have already gone through the second reading in Parliament and I hope that we will shortly go through conciliation and after that an Auto‐Oil II process to follow. The clear objectives of this very ambitious programme will require car manufacturers to make cleaner engines and also oblige oil companies to make cleaner petrol and diesel fuels. It is part of our role in Parliament to ensure that those objectives are met on time. For this reason, Parliament is pressing the industry to go further and faster than the Commission and Council proposals, with which Parliament generally agrees, are initially suggesting.</p>
<p class="contents">We recognize very clearly the difficulties of the car and oil industries in reaching these objectives and we have listened very carefully to their points of view – in particular, the oil industry whose interests are very close to my own constituency. However, with regard to the points that they have made, I would say that experience of putting similar measures into place in other parts of the world indicates that the costs they are suggesting are not quite what they claim.</p>
<p class="contents">If you examine, for example, independent consultants' reports, they are telling us that those costs are in fact 17 % cheaper for petrol and 55 % cheaper for diesel than the Commission itself is proposing. As regards the cost to the general consumer, the ordinary car driver, we are talking about £5‐10 a year for the average car driver or ECU 5‐8 in some other parts of Europe.</p>
<p class="contents">We know that structural changes are foreseen in the oil industry, and we know those structural changes will take place regardless of what happens with the Auto‐Oil proposals which will make very little difference to them. However, the overall benefits of the programme can not be denied, be they an improvement in air quality, in public health and also the avoidance of crop damage and eutrophication. I think it is now time that we all commit ourselves to those objectives so that in ten years' time we have those cleaner cities in which children and adults can live free of respiratory illness.</p>

 Mr President, Madam Commissioner, Commissioner, I am delighted to see the Commission so impressively represented here today. It shows how important this report is, and it also shows that there is a diversity of opinion in the Commission as well as in Parliament.</p>
<p class="contents">Commissioner, I am pleased to hear you say that although it may not be possible to reach any joint decisions today, there is every chance of finding a way forward in the Conciliation Committee. I am amazed that this House seems to be afraid that if we go into the Conciliation Committee the outcome could be even worse. I am convinced that we would come out of the conciliation procedure in a stronger position, if we try to build on the principles you have described. Your principles were based on the proposed Auto‐Oil II. But that marriage is over – the bonds between the automotive and oil industries have been broken. However, that is no reason for the European Parliament to abandon its parliamentary duty, we have to carry on. The divorce judge gave us a great tip, and we are now introducing Auto‐Oil II. All these plans seem quite logical at first, but they do not really get us anywhere.</p>
<p class="contents">There is one thing we must not forget: we have quite rightly dismantled the internal borders within the Community, providing flexibility for goods, services and people. Of course, flexibility includes the free movement of people: that means that there are now 200 million cars on Europe's roads, heaven help us. I am not about to suggest getting rid of them. Nevertheless, these cars have an impact on the economy, on the environment and on health. It is these three points that we need to weigh up. So we do not want the kind of go‐slow proposals that we associate with the oil industry; no, we want exciting proposals which will assist innovative industries.</p>
<p class="contents">I would like to mention two or three examples. The on‐board diagnostics system has a great many advantages. I am the last person to tinker with a screw‐driver, but I would like to put a stop to the process of concentration in the car maintenance sector. I do not want to find myself being forced to take my car to the same company that built it, just because well‐qualified workshops and garages do not have free access to this on‐board diagnostics system. I am, of course, against electronically‐blocked car bonnets, because if we have a breakdown we will end up standing there with the man from our motoring organization and wondering what to do next, because the car will not go. They need to have proper access. That does not mean to say that car designers have to give the blueprints away, they do need some protection of course. But we must not throw out the baby with the bath water. So we are ready to compromise too.</p>
<p class="contents">We have heard an impressive description of the cold start test. It is a long‐standing myth that you can only test cars in Tuscany, where it is nice and warm – it also has to be done where I live, where it is often very cold, 7˚C or less. The cars should run a few kilometres there; we should carry out some tests somewhere like that. I am sure that is not impossible for our innovation‐minded industry.</p>
<p class="contents">As for exhaust gas values, is there really such a big difference between us? I would really like to see that for cars. I can scarcely believe there is a problem. I think it is the mandatory nature of the values where we differ. But those of us who studied business management were always told that mandatory targets were a good thing, because we can make calculations when we have money coming in. Otherwise it sometime suits us and sometimes does not. So I cannot comprehend this, and I am certainly not one of the devotees of social policy in this House, but one of the ones who is self‐employed.</p>
<p class="contents">There are some areas, such as the combined approach on hydrocarbons and NOx, which we can discuss. Those are specialist areas where we are always ready to compromise. The story about the durability test has been explained very convincingly. But there must also be a happy medium here – it is another possible case for the Conciliation Committee. Why should we not be just as good as the Americans for once? What is stopping us?</p>
<p class="contents">I would like to turn to costs now. Of all the speakers so far, I am the one who has been in this House the longest, and I remember the debate about catalytic converters. To the ladies and gentlemen lobbyists up there, whose role I quite accept, I must say that I do not claim to have the exact figures, and even if I did have them, I would not trust my own figures. However, I can remember the arguments that the industry put forward then, when they told us that lead‐free petrol would cost 18 pfennigs a litre. As the ladies and gentlemen representing the oil industry know very well, the price is now less than 1.8 pfennig a litre! What was it you told us then – we can check in the Minutes – about the cost of catalytic converters? Let us take your figures – today they cost ten times less than the DM 5 000 forecast then. I just do not believe you when it comes to money and costs, because I have learnt from experience. That is why I think we should try to sort things out in the Conciliation Committee. Mr Bangemann, you know full well that up to now, when we have been involved in environmental matters, we have always come up with respectable, dare I say middle‐class results. That is a great incentive for this House. I am not thinking of giving in – the battle is only just beginning!</p>

 Mr President, we are in the final stages of a discussion which the European institutions have been dealing with for several years. We will vote and tell the Commission and Council what direction the European Parliament wishes to give to the motor sector and the fuel sector in the near future, a future which has two specific deadlines, according to the reports being discussed: the year 2000 and the year 2005. This latter deadline of 2005 should be fixed by law and not left as a hypothetical deadline: the motor and oil industries should be given a specific time, a specific deadline for the industries themselves to be able to plan investments, developments and research: the date of 2005, to be precise. On the other hand, we need to eliminate all unrealistic measures against the objective of the single market. Members have recalled more than one of these.</p>
<p class="contents">What we are dealing with today is only apparently a division between the vehicle and oil sectors. In fact, the two sectors have to be united in their future planning. The objective is to make products – vehicles on the one hand and fuels and lubricants on the other – that are increasingly more ecocompatible and for that purpose increasingly more closely connected with each other. It is unthinkable now, although it has been considered in the recent past, that vehicle and oil should reason without any connection. They are not directly contrasted and it will be difficult for them to be so in the future, in the search for products for final users containing an intrinsic social commitment: the protection and improvement of the environment against pollution.</p>
<p class="contents">From an economic point of view, it should be more beneficial for the final user to buy a product – vehicle or petrol – that is increasingly less harmful to the environment and, consequently, the industries involved should invest in quality. Our task and that of the national institutions is to support, assist and direct the qualitative efforts made by the vehicle and oil companies.</p>
<p class="contents">There are also other problems to be solved: think of the problem of taxation. There are too many differences within the Community in terms of taxation on vehicles and fuels from one Member State to another, which means that some industries and sectors are penalized and their resources, which otherwise could be allocated to research and technological improvement, withdrawn. We are therefore against the amendments to the Lange report that alter Council"s common position on tax incentives.</p>
<p class="contents">With regard to the Auto‐Oil sector, enormous opportunities and potential revolve around the motor product: in employment, no longer in terms of quantity but above all in quality – think of vocational training; in science, with increasing research and experimentation; in the economy, because there are thousands of small and medium‐sized businesses alongside the few large industrial firms, ranging from spare parts to repairs; and, finally, in the social field.</p>
<p class="contents">Environmental protection is largely based on a reduction in the pollution generated by vehicles today. In these months" work, several people have regretted the proposals made by the two rapporteurs and the Commission: some industries, some geographical areas, and some old refineries that do not want to be modernized. The search for a better environment is a battle that may leave several wounded on the field. We will be able to help some of them, but we cannot stop the healthy ones who want to move ahead.</p>

 Mr President, I could be very brief by saying that I fully agree with the words of Mr Florenz. To add something to this and to use my two minutes, I would like to say that, should these 314, a minimum of 314 colleagues agree with the Hautala and Lange reports tomorrow, the European Parliament will be writing history. It will mean that Parliament will have a cast‐iron negotiating position to enter into conciliation with the Council. Then we can show the citizens of Europe that we have done our utmost to remove them further from the misery of smog in the large European cities. Mr President, this is all the more true because the rapporteurs have shown that Parliament is able to meet its responsibilities by seeking clear conciliation with the Council at second reading on the standards of fuels.</p>
<p class="contents">To get the best end result we will have to water things down a little, however. We have to agree with a transitionary regulation for areas where socio‐economic problems make a quick, complete implementation of these directives difficult. And the Spaniards and other people from the southern Member States along with the representatives in this Parliament should take good note of this if, tomorrow, they will also agree with the amendments of both rapporteurs.</p>
<p class="contents">We have to stick with the compulsory standards for the year 2005, Mr President. The industry has shown itself capable of delaying Auto‐Oil I by a few years, with the result that these directives will not enter into force until 2000. The car industry requires low sulphur fuels in order to apply its newest technologies, such as the next generation catalytic converter, and we can only be certain that these will actually come onto the market if we have compulsory standards.</p>
<p class="contents">I therefore call on my colleagues not to be misguided by arguments which argue in the contrary. Only through compulsory standards in 2005 will industry be able to prepare itself properly. This is extremely important both for our environment and for the economy. Indicative standards will delay improvement of the environment again by years. I look forward with full confidence to the conciliation after the vote tomorrow.</p>

<p class="contents">Question No 60 by Heidi Hautala (H−0006/98)</p>
<p class="contents">Subject: Regulation on openness</p>
<p class="contents">Under the Amsterdam Treaty, the institutions of the Union are to conduct themselves with considerably greater openness than at present, particularly as regards documents.</p>
<p class="contents">Will the Commission draft a proposal for a Regulation as soon as possible, so that the Regulation can enter into force immediately that the Amsterdam Treaty does so?</p>
<p class="contents">Is it intended that public access to documents should apply to all documents in the possession of the Union's institutions – i.e. legislative, implementary and administrative documents?</p>
<p class="contents">Does public access to documents apply to all the institutions?</p>
<p class="contents">What kind of exceptions does the Commission intend to propose?</p>

 The Commission would remind the author of the question that, according to the provisions of the new Article 255 introduced by the Treaty of Amsterdam, the citizen has the right of access to the documents of the European Parliament, the Council and the Commission, subject to the principles and limits the Council has to determine, according to the codecision procedure, within two years of the entry into force of the Treaty.</p>
<p class="contents">On the basis of these general principles which are common to the three institutions, each one should draw up its own regulations on the specific provisions regarding application. The Commission will therefore submit a draft legislation, according to the entry into force of the Treaty. So far, no decision has been taken on the exceptions to the right of access the Commission should propose.</p>
<p class="contents">Without any doubt, the Commission considers it essential to develop the policy of transparency and access to its documents, but the future legislation on this matter depends on the result of the interinstitutional negotiations.</p>
<p class="contents">Naturally, the declaration included in the final document will be observed, which allows each Member State to ask the Commission or the Council not to disclose a document originating from the country itself without prior permission.</p>

 Mr President, I have three short questions. I would like clarification of whether this document will concern all or just three – the most important three – bodies mentioned in the Amsterdam Treaty: the Commission, Parliament and the Council. Personally, I think it should be a matter for all to consider.</p>
<p class="contents">Next, I would like to ask about very sensitive issues. Is it understood that Europe"s future central bank should be subordinate to public legislation? In addition, Europol cooperation has proved to be an area where there is a need for more openness.</p>
<p class="contents">Finally, I would like to ask whether the Commission could not put together some sort of Green Paper on the subject of openness so that all bodies, including Parliament, could discuss in broad terms what should be done concerning this document? I think this would be an excellent way to proceed.</p>

 As a general outline to this additional answer, I have to say, Mr Hautala, that the general secretaries of the three Institutions concerned have already held specific meetings to discuss this point and have formed an interinstitutional working party, under the direction of the Commission, which has been given the task of conducting a preliminary study of the problem. The working parties have already been set up and the group is currently reflecting on the questions to be dealt with in the proposal for the future legislation.</p>
<p class="contents">I wish to ask you, Mr Hautala, whether it will be applied to the three institutions? As I recalled, according to the provisions of Article 255, it is a question of access to the documents of the European Parliament, the Council and the Commission and there will be general principles common to the three institutions, on the basis of which each of the three institutions will then draw up its own regulations for specific application.</p>

 Mr President, I would like to ask the Commissioner whether his studies also cover the internal workings of Parliament, because we have a body, the Conference of Presidents of the various groups, which keeps the Parliamentarians in the dark, and takes all sorts of decisions in secret meetings that we hear nothing about. Could this be sorted out? The second thing I wanted to ask is this: what is your attitude to the idea of forcing the European Central Bank to make a public declaration of this kind, which would have the effect of opening the doors to American speculators?.

 With regard to the European Central Bank, I have nothing to say, as Article 255 does not refer to this institution. With regard to the first question, it seems to me that, as the Member said himself, it relates to the European Parliament"s internal documents and it is therefore not up to the Commission to give an opinion in this connection.</p>

 I would like to ask whether the Commission supports the principle of reversing the burden of proof which was passed by a large majority of Parliament in part‐session and by the Committee on Institutional Affairs by 34 votes to 0. According to this, the basis for any decision must be that the documents and meetings are open, unless a qualified majority of two thirds of those present at Commission meetings, in Parliament or at Council meetings decides that a meeting or document should be closed for good reason. In other words, we should reverse the burden of proof, so it takes a qualified majority to close a document. Can the Commission support this principle which was passed unanimously by our committees?</p>

This site is currently being prepared: the actual date for its opening should be in the spring of 1998 and will be announced officially by the Official Publications Office of the European Communities.</p>
<p class="contents">The EuroLaw server will enable users to access the following services free of charge and in progression: the list of Community legislation in force, supplemented by the texts of the documents shown in the list by their title alone, as shown in the CELEX data bank; the collection of EU treaties; the consolidated text of the Community legislative documents; the recent judgments of the European Court of Justice; and the COM documents. Consequently, all the legislative texts in force will be extracted by CELEX and made available to EuroLaw users free of charge.</p>
<p class="contents">For the time being, however, the Commission is not planning to offer the CELEX data bank for consultation via the Internet free of charge. It should be recalled that CELEX offers a very wide range of advanced research possibilities and that the proceeds deriving from consultation of the base are used to finance part of the considerable work of documentary analysis required to give CELEX its specific added value.</p>
<p class="contents">The Commission shares the Member"s opinion that it is advisable to inform citizens of the Union"s decision‐making mechanisms and the functioning of the interinstitutional procedures. For this purpose, it plans to present the principal interinstitutional procedures in the form of a diagram, in order to be concise.</p>
<p class="contents">Moreover, to the extent that resources are available and in cooperation with the services of Parliament, the Commission will try to circulate general information on the state of the current procedures, an objective that will be realized, in particular, through modernizing and putting the APC system that is already accessible to the public on the Internet.</p>

 I thank the Commissioner for his answer. I would like to put one more question: when is it going to be clear that through this EuroLaw link people will be able to see how far the Member States have incorporated the law into national legislation? We currently have an experiment as far as Finnish legislation is concerned, but what does the Commissioner think of the possibilities of getting information about the situation in all Member States through the same service?</p>
<p class="contents">In addition, I think it is important that in future this server has the technology to make it easy to see what is news, so‐called ‚push technology’, which your colleague Commissioner Oreja has promised to consider, and which I hope can be implemented very soon. I believe that for easier use it is important that people also get news quickly.</p>

 I would like to say to Mr Thors that it had been hoped that the EuroLaw server would be available immediately on the Internet. This is not possible. To do that, preliminary adaptations need to be made to all the technical devices, particularly those of the Publications Office; everything will be ready in a few months" time. We understand the urgency and importance of this tool and every effort will be made to make it available as soon as possible.</p>
<p class="contents">I will take this opportunity, and the specific question raised by Mr Thors on the importance to the citizen of knowing whether the Member States have included the Community regulations, to indicate another information tool. In the wide range of material on the internal market, since November 1997 the Commission has been publishing a scoreboard, a periodic report, that indicates the situation of each Member State as regards the inclusion of directives, the observance of infringement procedures, and so on; this scoreboard is already available on the Internet. As you can see, we are certainly heading in the direction rightly hoped for by Mr Thors with all the means available.</p>

 In around half the Member States of the European Union, there is a unified tariff for sending correspondence at national and intra‐Community level in the faster standard category belonging to the first‐weight group. In the other Member States, tariffs vary according to the destination, usually depending on whether it is national or intraCommunity correspondence.</p>
<p class="contents">Directive 97/67/EC on postal services states that the prices of each of the services forming part of the supply of the universal service should be correlated with costs. This obligation applies to all the correspondence in question, whether national or intraCommunity. This could encourage some Member States to rectify the current charging system for their own postal services to that effect.</p>
<p class="contents">The Treaty establishing the European Community, and particularly Article 6, does not prohibit a similar tariff differentiation provided it is commensurate with costs, as laid down by the aforesaid Directive 97/67/EC.</p>

A change in pricing to the structure of the international tariff within the United Kingdom is proposed from 6 April this year. At present the first‐weight rate charge is the same for domestic and EU post. The proposal is for domestic post to stay at 26p but for EU post to increase to 30p. There is also a proposal that the non‐EU rate be decreased from 31p to 30p which effectively classes the EU alongside all other foreign post.</p>
<p class="contents">I would submit that is contrary to Article 6 and therefore there is a responsibility upon the Commission to ask for an explanation from the United Kingdom postal authorities on this point. Can you please reply in detail?</p>

 I wish to thank Mr White for further clarifying the context of his question.</p>
<p class="contents">There may actually be an apparent contradiction between single tariff and price correlated with costs, but it is only an apparent contradiction. Article 12 of the Directive on postal services states, on the one hand, that prices shall be correlated with costs and, on the other, that the Member States may decide whether to apply a single tariff to the entire national territory. These two statements may seem to be contradictory. However, the obligation on the correlation of costs does not imply a total coincidence between price and cost and leaves the Member State the possibility of applying a system of making tariffs equal for specific provisions of the universal service.</p>
<p class="contents">I would add that applying a tariff distinction based on costs between national and intra‐Community post or, possibly, between post to different Member States, does not constitute an infringement of Article 6 of the Treaty, as such a distinction is not based on nationality but rather on the criterion of the actual cost the provision of different services entails.</p>

<p class="contents">According to the Treaty, the Schengen measures on checks at external borders, asylum, immigration and judicial cooperation in civil matters should come under Title IV of the Treaty establishing the European Community, while the provisions on police and judicial cooperation in criminal matters should come under Title VI of the Treaty on European Union, the third pillar. In the Commission's view, what should the SIS (and later the EIS) come under? Article 286 of the Treaty says that from 1 January 1999 Community decisions on the protection of individuals with regard to the processing and free movement of personal data shall apply to the institutions and bodies set up by, or on the basis of, the Treaty.

 The question raised by Mrs Van Lancker is fundamental in nature and requires a brief but comprehensive answer. The principle of the integration of the Schengen acquis into the EU has been sanctioned in the protocol attached to the Treaty of Amsterdam. To achieve this integration, various measures have been adopted, including the decision by the Council, as provided for in paragraph 1 of Article 2 of the protocol, based on the relevant provisions of the Treaties, establishing the legal basis for each of the provisions or decisions constituting the Schengen acquis.</p>
<p class="contents">Pursuant to the provisions of the Treaty on European Union currently in force, the distribution of the Schengen acquis between the first and the third pillars would have been a very difficult task on account of the unclear distinction between the areas of competence of the two pillars mentioned. However, the Treaty of Amsterdam provides greater clarity and the distribution should not raise too many problems.</p>
<p class="contents">As regards, in particular, the division of the provisions on the Schengen Information System, the Commission considers that a dual legal base should be established in relation to the first and third pillars. In fact, the Schengen Information System collects data relating to both the first and third pillars. Article 96 of the Schengen Agreement, on the categories of aliens to be refused entry, refers to external frontier controls and visa and immigration policy and therefore to data belonging to the first pillar.</p>
<p class="contents">Other categories of data, such as definitions provided for extradition purposes, unquestionably fall under police and legal cooperation in criminal matters and therefore come under the third pillar.</p>
<p class="contents">The establishment of a dual legal base should not be detrimental to the operation of the Schengen Information System. The dual legal base is not something new. The Customs Information System is also based on a regulation from the first pillar and an agreement from the third pillar based on the same text.</p>
<p class="contents">With regard to specific Schengen provisions on data protection within the scope of the Schengen Information System, a dual legal base should be established, comprising the first and third pillars. The same regulations should be applied to data protection with regard to sectors coming under the first and third pillars, in the exchange of information through the SIS. Finally, the question as to whether Article 286 of the EC Treaty will be applied to the Schengen Information System has not yet been resolved.</p>

 I would like to start by thanking the Commissioner for his interpretation. I think it agrees fully with my own. The necessary instruments for the implementation of the new Community pillar with regards to free movement of people cannot come under the third pillar. But, Mr Commissioner, I am getting strong indications from the Council, and not only from one Member State within the Council, but from several of them, that the Council has a completely different opinion. It seems that someone in the Council is saying quite forcefully that the entire Schengen Information System, and therefore also the European Information System, should come under the third pillar, with all its consequences for parliamentary and judicial control and for the European Commission"s right of legislative initiative in this rather delicate affair. Can the Commissioner tell me which arguments, legal and political, the Commission can produce to win over the Council, and that it will not start fiddling with the adequate legal base which must be used in this matter so that the Schengen Protocol might be properly categorized?</p>

 I have to say that current efforts and the work I have briefly described is ongoing, despite being complex. In the declaration relating to Article 2 of the Schengen Protocol, the Member States agree that the Council should take all the necessary measures laid down by Article 2 as well as that relating therefore to the distribution just mentioned, by the date of entry into force of the Treaty of Amsterdam. For this purpose, it establishes that the preparatory work should begin in good time to be completed before that date.</p>
<p class="contents">I have to say that, after the signing of the Treaty of Amsterdam, the Luxembourg Presidency began work within the Council and that the current British Presidency has taken it over immediately. Various meetings are already planned to observe the timetable which has been established. Some results have already been achieved, and this allows us to believe that the deadlines will be observed. We therefore have no reason to be pessimistic.</p>
<p class="contents">I well understand the Member"s concern, but it is obvious that the Commission has taken an active and constructive part in the Council"s work on this matter, to ensure that the integration of the Schengen acquis, within the scope of the European Union, takes place in full compliance with the law of the European Community and the European Union.</p>
<p class="contents">It seems obvious to me that the European Parliament is involved in distributing the Schengen acquis, as this distribution will establish the legal base for future proposals seeking to amend the Schengen acquis and therefore relates to Parliament"s role with regard to these future proposals.</p>
<p class="contents">I therefore propose that the Council duly submits to the European Parliament the draft decision on the distribution of the Schengen acquis.</p>

 My question about the Schengen Information System concerns the supervisory function of the JSA, the <span class="italic">Joint Supervisory Authority</span>
. This authority is responsible for checking that the rules which exist for this system are respected.

<p class="contents">The JSA also emphasizes that it has totally inadequate resources to carry out the investigation it wants, including budgetary resources and resources for translation. It also underlines that it has been denied access to the SIS computer here in Strasbourg on at least one occasion when it has tried to carry out an on‐site inspection with its experts.</p>

 Mr President, Commissioner, I think it has become clear how closely connected Title IV of the EC Treaty and Title VI of the EU Treaty are. I would like to ask you about the connection between the issue of external borders, which is dealt with in one, and the issue of fighting organized crime, which is dealt with in the other.

 Your comment highlights the very purpose of these constructions: to provide space for freedom of movement and at the same time space for security. Schengen arose within this perspective and is operating within this perspective; its incorporation into the Treaty of Amsterdam is also moving decidedly within this perspective. The information structures should reflect this fundamental dual objective.</p>

 Mr President, the French organizing committee of the World Cup at first envisaged a system of ticket distribution based on territorial exclusiveness which would essentially not have permitted the sale of tickets in other Member States of the European Union. It also envisaged linking ticket sales to other services such as accommodation and travel. Following an approach by the European Commission, the organizing committee agreed to make changes which would enable both specific tour operators and travel agencies firstly, to sell either tickets alone or packages of services, and secondly, to sell them in other countries. This ensures competition between various distributors throughout the European Union.</p>
<p class="contents">After complaints in the press regarding the infringement of European rules of competition so far as the sale of tickets for the football World Cup 1998 was concerned, the Commission has approached the French organizing committee and five tour operators selected for the sale of tickets in the UEFA area. Replies to those letters are being awaited and we believe that when we receive them the Commission will be able to form a complete picture of how the French organizing committee set about distributing tickets, and to ascertain whether and to what extent the rules of competition have been contravened. If Community law has been infringed, that will most probably be due to contravention of the European rules of competition, mainly Articles 85 and 86 of the Treaty, rather than an infringement of the law in relation to the Cassis de Dijon affair mentioned by the Member, which covers the elimination of quota restrictions on imports between the Member States pursuant to Article 30 of the Treaty. At any rate, no such infringement has so far been confirmed where the distribution of tickets for the football World Cup 1998 is concerned.</p>

<p class="contents">I am grateful to the Commissioner for his answer. Clearly under Article 7a of the Single European Act, and indeed under Article 85, it must be held that any product lawfully put on sale in one part of the Union cannot be barred from being imported into any other. Indeed, the Commission has just fined Volkswagen some £68 million for breach of this principle.</p>
<p class="contents">It is my information that the French authorities are preventing ticket agencies and tour operators from selling tickets outside France. A ticket, for example, for the Brazil v Scotland match which would cost £50 in France, has been on sale on the black market in Britain for nearly £800. Did the French authorities consult the Commission before making their arrangements?</p>
<p class="contents">Does the Commissioner not agree that this is outrageous and does he not agree that it contravenes EU principles? Will he take action against France if it is found to be in breach of the Treaties?</p>

 Mr President, first of all let me tell you that the ball at the front of Mr Watson's bench reminds me of my childhood years, when I too had the chance to engage in this wonderful sport. I would, however, like to make some comments on what Mr Watson said. As I mentioned before, we are waiting for replies to the letters we sent to the tour operators and the French authorities. So far, we have no information confirming the accusations that a specific infringement is indeed taking place. What I must say, however, as a general principle, is that the Commission believes that competition among the various suppliers and products certainly benefits the consumer compared with a system of exclusive distribution and committed ticket sales. We will insist that the rules of competition must be applied, and we believe we will be successful.</p><table border="0" cellpadding="0" cellspacing="0" width="100%">

<p class="contents">On what quantitative criteria is the Commission basing its insistence that the Director‐General for Energy in the Spanish Mining Planning Department call on companies under contract to cut production and jobs by specific percentages? Does the Commission really believe that it is admissible under Decision No 3632/93/ECSC<a href="#def_10_1" name="ref_10_1"><sup>(1)</sup></a>

 to observe the criterion of “comparable effort to other countries’, given that the concept of “Community average cost’ was dropped while the Decision was being discussed and approved by the Council and Parliament? Does the Commission consider it possible to equate different national situations in terms of energy dependence and employment and economic development indicators? Is it not the case that the abandonment or drastic cut in coal production in the United Kingdom, France, and Belgium resulted from energy policy decisions taken by those countries acting on their own authority?</p>

<img align="absmiddle" alt="" src="/doceo/data/img/arrow_summary.gif"/>  <span class="doc_subtitle_level1_bis">Papoutsis, </span> <span class="italic">Member of the Commission. – (EL)</span>
 Mr President, thank you for giving me the opportunity to give a global answer to the questions raised by the Members, but of course I hope that I will have your understanding, because my answer will take up some time.</p>
<p class="contents">First of all, I want to express the Commission's concern at the social and regional consequences of the recession affecting the European Union's coal industry. That recession is the consequence of the geological difficulties encountered by the industry and the exceptionally high cost of production they lead to. The production costs of Spanish coalmines are unfortunately no exception. The Commission is aware of the difficulties engendered by the necessary economic changes in some areas. That is why, as an exception, it provided in Decision 3632/93/ECSC that Member States had the right to provide aid to companies with no prospect of economic viability for the cessation of their activities, so permitting them to adapt gradually to market realities within the framework of winding up their activities.</p>
<p class="contents">On that point, Mrs García Arias asked us whether the abandonment or significant reduction of coal production in France, Belgium and the UK was the result of sovereign decisions by those countries themselves concerning their energy policy. Clearly, the decisions mentioned in the question are based mainly on awareness in the Member States in question that the future of the industry is very bleak in some areas. That is why they decided that the cost of subsidies from overall social resources should be channelled towards public expenditure that supports activities with a guaranteed and secure future. From the Commission's point of view, all those decisions were the subject of examination and conclusions based on Community law. The specific question, along with others put by various Members of Parliament, seems to call the Commission's role into question in relation to coal, when decisions in that branch have an impact on issues of energy policy, social dialogue and employment.</p>
<p class="contents">I remind you, therefore, that among the European Commission's direct responsibilities is to approve subsidies which Member States propose to provide for the coal mining industry, pursuant to Decision 3632/93/ECSC. And in carrying out that task, the Commission pays full respect to the national particularities to which honourable Members have referred, and secures the cooperation of the states with due respect for their own respective competences. Besides, the Commission is ready and willing to listen to all interested parties, who have the right to present their views and comments by virtue of Article 46 of the ECSC Treaty.</p>
<p class="contents">Mrs García Arias asked about the criteria used as a basis by the Commission within the framework of the Community system for intervention by the Member States on behalf of the coal industry, of 28 October 1993. I would not wish to go into details at this time concerning how that matter is being investigated, since the Commission is doing this at the moment and there need to be questions added relating to competition in the common market for coal. I can tell you, however, that in analysing the programmes for winding up the activities of companies, the Commission will not base its procedures on criteria of comparative efforts with other countries, and I believe that Mrs García Arias is fully aware of developments concerning the coal mines in the countries mentioned in her question.</p>
<p class="contents">In the case of Asturias, the Commission takes account of the exceptional social and regional factors mentioned in Article 4 of Decision 3632/93/ECSC. Consequently, it accepts that the units should close down after 23 July 2002, but within the scope of a programme of gradual and continuous running‐down of the activity, which should lead to a substantial decrease well before the aforesaid date when the ECSC Treaty lapses. In that context, the Commission, which is considering a file on programmes for the discontinuation of activities by various companies, has made certain observations and asked for certain information, to leave it in a position to arrive at a specific opinion. These observations are justified, firstly, by the serious deviations noted during implementation of the programmes by specific companies between 1994 and 1997, and secondly, because their aim is to bring the programmes announced into line with the objectives of Article 4 of Decision 3632/93/ECSC. Based on its decisions, therefore, the Commission is entitled, whenever it makes observations or renders an opinion, to refer to quantified objectives. I believe the observations made by the Commission are realistic ones, and ones which will not affect either the social conditions of workers about to lose their jobs, or the regional reconstruction programmes envisaged in the planning.</p>
<p class="contents">I think it is also useful to recall that in connection with policy on coal, it did not prove possible in the discussions with the Council to adopt the principle of the Community reference cost, because it was deemed that this would constitute an unduly technical measure. For that very reason, agreement was reached to apply a principle of scaling down aid in the light of coal prices on the international market, a factor which is also a quantitative criterion. Indeed, the aid would not have been regarded as transitional, except only to permit eventual competitiveness or to contribute towards solving the social and regional problems associated with the run‐down of the branch.</p>
<p class="contents">Mr Izquierdo Collado wonders about the importance attached by the Commission to the principle of social dialogue. I must say, and I say so here, that the European Commission attaches great importance to that principle, which is embodied in the Treaty on European Union. In the same spirit, it ensures that agreements signed in the Member States, including their legislative orders, must comply with the Treaty on European Union. It is therefore permissible for the Commission to examine the agreements signed between the Spanish government and the trade union organizations, and verify their compliance with the Treaty before they are implemented.</p>
<p class="contents">I would like to look at the conflict alluded to by Mr Izquierdo Collado. As the Commission carries out the responsibilities assigned to it under Decision 3632/93/ECSC, it is investigating, and I repeat, it is still investigating, the file with the restructuring plans in relation to which the granting of state subsidies to Spain's coal industry will be analysed. Precisely because of the complexity of the problem, and because of the climate prevailing today in the Community's coal industry, the Commission is compelled, under the provisions of the specific Decision, to carry out in‐depth investigations so that it is in a position to render an opinion on the issue as a whole. If it is confirmed that this is consistent with Community law, the Commission will then give the green light for the provision of that aid. And in that framework the procedures for investigating these matters are covered by confidentiality, and are therefore not the source of social conflict as the Member implied. Since we are speaking about social dialogue, it is appropriate to stress that none of the parties has approached the Commission to investigate in advance, matters that fall within the Commission's authority.</p>

 I am afraid the Commissioner has not answered my question. I am asking him to tell me the quantitative criteria, to explain to me why the Commission said that the reduction of several thousand workers, their jobs, and hundreds of tonnes was not enough and instead set out specific percentages. I do not know those criteria and I would like an answer.</p>
<p class="contents">Furthermore, since we are being so precise, I should like to ask the Commission why it did not ask the Spanish government, in that same letter, why it has not yet included all the additional aid in the Spanish budget. Why is there so much pressure on one side, while the Spanish government is being shown flexibility in the other respect? I would be very interested to know whether Article 4 actually describes case by case – taking into account the regional criteria – the criteria used by the Directorate‐General for Energy in saying that the reduction had to take one form or another, especially in view of the fact that negotiations had already taken place in Spain.</p>

 Mr President, I want to assure the Member that the European Commission implements the Treaty in all countries and in all cases in exactly the same way. There are no special cases and there are no special interpretations in each case. However, the Commission must render an opinion about the extent to which any programme announced by the Member States responds to the general and particular objectives of Decision 3632/93/ECSC. That is also exactly the lodestone that guides our actions. Naturally, we recognize that the future of the coal industry is something of concern to us all. It is of concern not just to the regions and not just to the Member States. It is a subject to which the European Union should give particular weight, precisely because of the major social and economic problems created in all the countries. It is with this in mind that we will take further action. As for the case in question, there were no prior consultations with the Spanish government. What did happen, however, was that an effort was made by the Commission to get close to the problem, to monitor developments and to examine all the proposals submitted. Of course, we had contacts and cooperated with the unions and with civil servants. But there were no political negotiations or preliminary agreements between the Commission and the Spanish government.</p>

 Commissioner, I would like to focus on the purpose of the question, so as not to generalize. And the purpose of the question is that an agreement was reached between the mining unions and the Spanish government, and received massive media coverage. Along comes the European Union and starts criticizing and trying to add further cuts in jobs and production; and to do so, it uses the Spaniard, Mr Benavides, the Director‐General of Energy. People in Asturias are saying that Mr Benavides is being encouraged by the Spanish government itself, which had already signed that agreement. There is incredible frustration, huge tension in the sector, acts of extremism, street violence, a death in Asturias, a return to negotiations, a new agreement between the Spanish government and the mining unions, and now the Commission has to say its piece again. The Commission now has to say whether or not it is happy with this second agreement, although it is very similar to the first one.</p>
<p class="contents">When are we going to start sticking up for the European Union"s image and stop acting against our own image in such an incredible manner? It gives us a worse image than we already had.</p>

 Mr President, first I would like to make it clear that the European Commission expresses itself through its Commissioners. The Commission's political positions are valid when expressed by its Commissioners and mainly by those responsible for the sector in question.</p>
<p class="contents">I am not aware of the comments by the specific Director‐General you have mentioned, Mr Benavides. Mr Benavides is doing his job very properly and I do not know exactly what he said, nor do I know whether his comments were reported correctly. What I would like to confirm, however, and what I know, is what I myself have said: my own comments, and the expression of my own political will, both to the Spanish government and to the Spanish press. And you also know that my positions are very clear. We are waiting for the replies, we are waiting for the agreement to be completed and we will then examine it from the standpoint of its economic, but also more importantly its social consequences. In no case does the Commission intend either to create social explosions or to contribute towards exacerbating the social problems created. On the contrary, indeed, we are striving to find a solution based on the ECSC Treaty, based on the European Union Treaty, and of course based on the Spanish government's priorities, on those of the Asturias region and on local requirements.</p>
<p class="contents">We are always ready not only to discuss the specific agreement between the unions, the government and the companies, but are also ready to approve programmes which could contribute towards the development of the area in coming years, alternative forms of employment, the creation of other forms of economic development – and along those lines we are on the side of the people of Asturias –, and, of course, all the social and economic forces in the area. Along those lines, then, and I repeat, on the basis of the legitimacy conferred by the ECSC and the European Union Treaties, the Commission will cooperate both with the government and with the unions.</p>

 Commissioner, I am afraid our questions are the same. Mrs García Arias, Mr Morán López, Mr Puerta and myself had presented a question along the same lines, because it is true that there was a letter from Mr Benavides, and that letter was made public and produced a conflict with serious consequences in Asturias.</p>
<p class="contents">The question raises the fact that it is not just the mining situation that needs to be taken into account – the mining situation in Asturias is very serious – but also the situations in the iron and steel industry, shipbuilding, the rural areas and arms manufacture. In other words, a whole series of industrial sectors are all in decline, making Asturias a problem region.</p>
<p class="contents">The question is: considering not just the European Coal and Steel Community Treaty and the mining situation, but also considering all these aspects of industrial decline in Asturias, will this situation of decline be taken into account in the agreement which the unions have just reached, an agreement which is new and which seems at least to satisfy the hopes of the mining areas?</p>

 Mr President, yet again I would like to confirm that with particular care and political sensitivity the Commission will rely on consideration of the specific file so far as the coal industry in the Asturias region is concerned. I repeat that we are prepared to cooperate in the implementation of special programmes aiming to create new jobs.</p>
<p class="contents">However, so far as the agreement is concerned, the Commission has not yet completed its consideration. On the contrary, we are waiting for all the details and information so that we can prepare our recommendation to the European Commission, because as you know, the Commission's decision is the result of a collective process and it will be a collective decision by the body of Commissioners. But we must have all the facts and details so that we can justify the agreement reached.</p>
<p class="contents">I sincerely hope it will turn out to be within the legitimacy conferred by the Treaty, and that the agreement will therefore be approved by the Commission. In no case – I repeat – in no case does the Commission intend to cast fuel on the flames, or to contribute towards creating social problems. On the contrary, we will be on the side of the Spanish government, the productive and social forces of the country and the Asturias region, to find the best possible solution.</p>

<p class="contents">Subject: Community eco‐label award scheme</p>
<p class="contents">The Commission's proposal for a revised eco‐label award scheme proposes that all national eco‐labelling schemes should be confined to products for which no Community eco‐label criteria have been established. Moreover, the Commission proposes that the Community scheme should be self‐financing after four years.</p>
<p class="contents">It is very difficult for eco‐label schemes to become self‐financing; not even the most well‐established national eco‐label schemes manage to be so.</p>
<p class="contents">In the Commission's view, what will be the impact of replacing familiar, well‐established eco‐label schemes, which enjoy a high level of consumer confidence, with a relatively unknown Community scheme which is also to be self‐financing after only four years?</p>
<p class="contents">Can the Commission give any good examples of eco‐label schemes which are self‐financing? How is the environmental movement guaranteed influence over the Community's eco‐label scheme?</p>

<img align="absmiddle" alt="" src="/doceo/data/img/arrow_summary.gif"/>  <span class="doc_subtitle_level1_bis">Bjerregaard, </span> <span class="italic">Member of the Commission. – (DA)</span>
 Mr President, on the Commission's proposal to review the regulations on ecolabelling schemes, the European environmental marking organization (EMO) will receive financial support from the Commission for the first four years. EMO will also be entitled to 50 % of the annual eco‐labelling charges from the organizations responsible. These organizations will cover any additional costs. It is true that the Commission will not continue supporting the organization financially, but the EMO will be funded via the annual eco‐labelling charges, and the organizations responsible will continue to assist the EMO financially. The proceeds of the Community regulation charges depend on how successful the regulations are.</p>
<p class="contents">It may be worth stating that, in a single year and for a single product, the <span class="italic">Hoover New Wave</span>
 washing machine, the British ecolabelling council received more than ECU 250 000. According to information from the responsible organizations in the EC, the total income from EC charges in May 1997 – which involves 30 licences – was ECU 210 000. Since January 1998, we have already issued 35 licences for a total of 192 products. It is therefore highly likely that the EMO will be self‐financing. One positive development will depend on the EMO's ability to establish a number of product groups and the ability of the organizing bodies' markets capacity to acquire licences. It is important to emphasize on this point that a ceiling has been introduced for charges of ECU 40 000.</p>
<p class="contents">The Commission does not believe there will be any financial implications for national eco‐labels, as a transitional period has been allowed of five years in which it will be possible to market the European arrangements. In receiving the European credits, which are probably higher than national ones, the authorities will benefit from the new arrangements. And, finally, non‐governmental environmental organizations will be more closely involved with the EMO than under the current system.</p>

 I would like to thank Mrs Bjerregaard for her reply. I have two additional questions. The first question concerns what will happen after the five‐year transition period, i.e. when the Community eco‐label replaces the national eco‐labels where Community labels exist. If I have understood correctly, in practice there will be a ban on national labels in the areas covered by the Union's Community label. Moreover, this ban will apply whether or not the national eco‐labels make tougher demands on the products than the European eco‐label. Is that a correct understanding?</p>
<p class="contents">My second question concerns the influence of the environmental movement. There are very big differences between various countries in how much influence the environmental movement has over eco‐labels. How will a national environmental organization actually be able to influence the new eco‐label? How can people actively participate in this process? I think, you see, that this is very important for the credibility of the labelling.</p>

 In reply to that question, I would like to say that there is at present a Commission proposal which the Council has not yet dealt with at all. In other words, we are provisionally discussing the proposals we have put forward, and of course there has been some consideration as to what will happen about national systems and the European system. When we look at the successful, efficient national schemes which exist – the German system with the blue angel and the Scandinavian system with the swan –, it is actually quite clear that national schemes mainly confer environmental markings on national products. The allocation is very clearly out of balance. If an environmental mark is to have any meaning in European terms, it must of course cover Europe as a whole. So we decided that a five‐year transitional period would make it possible to bring national schemes into line with a European system so we end up with a situation which is better and not worse, as the Member asking the question indicates by referring to a situation where we had higher standards than we would have under the European system. It is definitely not our intention that that should be the result.</p>
<p class="contents">Nothing has been said about what the response will be to what happens after the five years. This is a period of adjustment and we believe it can proceed peacefully and smoothly. With the new structure for the proposals, we believe that the environmental organizations will have more opportunity for involvement than they did under the old system. But I am aware that the environmental organizations themselves did not think so, and so we have also been in touch with them to ensure that there are no further misunderstandings as such.</p>

 The Commission is aware of the project to relocate tanneries, as it comes under Community funding as part of the operational programme for industry under the Community support framework for Greece. The project aims to set up a tannery at Bootia in Greece, to which old tanneries spread over a number of other areas, including the Greater Athens area, can be moved in accordance with the new technological and environmental requirements. A number of studies were carried out at a previous stage, to ensure that the information required to implement the projects is available, even if they have not actually started yet. The Greek authorities responsible found that it was necessary to assess the effects on the environment on the basis of the project's nature. This assessment was carried out under the national provisions in implementing Directive 85/337: and, at the end of the procedure, the minister approved the project with a number of environmental requirements to be observed.</p>
<p class="contents">The Commission does not have any detailed information on the assessment, as this procedure is the responsibility of the national authorities, and the Commission only intervenes in the event of any infringements. A formal complaint about the project, and the EIA in particular, reached the Commission on 22 January 1998. The Commission's departments are in the process of examining this complaint in accordance with current procedures, while at the same time the matter will be raised at the next meeting of the regulatory committee for the operational programme for the industry. The Greek authorities will then provide the information required.</p>
<p class="contents">As part of hearing the complaint, the Commission's departments will gather more information on the precise position of the project to establish whether an area which is designated, or which may be designated, by the Greek authorities under Directive 79/409, or which is proposed as a special preservation area of Community significance under Directive 92/43 with a view to inclusion in the Natura 2000 project, should be affected by the project.</p>

 I thank the Commissioner for her answer to my question. In other words, if I have understood correctly, if these environmental studies which have not been done yet are submitted and there are consequences for the environment, there will be no cofinancing and the project will not go ahead. Because I cannot understand how cofinance was decided upon without a related study of environmental impact, when there is a great deal of opposition from the public and when the area is a known biotope. The Gulf of Evvoia, into which the tannery wastes will be discharged, is a closed sea. How is it possible, therefore, that cofinance has been approved without the related plans the Commissioner has just mentioned? And if there are these impacts on the environment – which there are –, I would like cofinancing to cease.</p>

 As I said in my reply, the position is that the Commission has received a complaint and has therefore been obliged to follow procedures: in other words, we are in the process of gathering the information required and, if there is any substance to the complaint, we will of course take the necessary action in connection with the project. But, as things are at the moment, I cannot say whether there is any substance to the complaint or not. What I can tell Mr Trakatellis is that we have received the complaint and that we are dealing with it.</p>

<p class="contents">Subject: Pollution of the Aegean</p>
<p class="contents">The ecological balance in the broader region of the eastern Mediterranean is seriously threatened by hundreds of pollutant industries located on the Turkish coast which, according to the UN, the OECD and the Ministry for the Aegean, have no sewage treatment facilities, in breach of international regulations. The pollutants discharged into the Aegean archipelago exceed the internationally accepted limits and constitute a veritable toxic bomb in the region. The nightmare is compounded by Turkey's recent decision to set up a nuclear plant on its south coast in the earthquake‐prone region of Akkuyu.</p>
<p class="contents">In what manner does the Commission intend to intervene and what measures will it take to safeguard the environmental balance in the region?</p>

 The situation to which the Member refers concerns environmental problems whose origins lie outside the area of the Community, so Community directives do not apply. The Commission suggested going into partnership with Turkey in the energy field as long ago as 1995; but restrictions on implementing the financial partnership with that country made it impossible to make any progress on that point. The Commission's communication on further developments in connection with Turkey of 15 July 1997 also proposed increasing cooperation in energy to safeguard the viable development of that country and integrate this sector into other economic policies. This cooperation means that funds are made available via the Community's budget.</p>
<p class="contents">Turkey is, however, a party to the convention on protecting the Mediterranean from pollution, known as the Barcelona Convention, and the special protocol on protecting the Mediterranean against land‐based pollution. Turkey is therefore bound to abide by the conditions of these international conventions insofar as they apply here. On the other hand, it is the Turkish government's responsibility alone to take the necessary decisions with a view to dealing with the pollution threatening the Aegean.</p>
<p class="contents">As far as Turkey's plans to build a nuclear power station in the Akkuyu area are concerned, it should be remembered that a decision on this subject, which is Turkey's responsibility alone, is based on an assessment of the country's overall energy requirements. This is not a project, however, which is of significance to the industrialized nations of the Community. The closing date for the Turkish authorities' international call for tenders to build the Akkuyu power station was 15 October 1997; and Turkey is currently considering tenders from the various consortia. The Turkish energy minister has stated that the final decision will be made in April 1998. The minister also said that the station is expected to become operable in 2006. From the information which the Commission has obtained, it appears that the Turkish authorities chose the Akkuyu area after a number of thorough surveys of the seismic, geological and environmental conditions, conducted by the specialist departments of a number of Turkish universities.</p>

 Madam Commissioner, thank you very much for your answers. Being aware of your sensitivity, however, I would have expected you to announce some specific measures to protect the Aegean, that uniquely beautiful archipelago, which is a precious heritage for the European Union. We know, of course, that pollution knows no frontiers, but we believe the European Union, via its cooperation agreements with Turkey, can exert pressure to make that country comply with its international obligations. Turkey has signed the international Barcelona Convention and there is no excuse for it to have such high pollution limits. For example, the cadmium limit set by Turkey is 2 mg, or 10 times higher than the European Union's limit. In addition, only 20 % of its industries have appropriate anti‐pollution installations. I believe the European Union can exert pressure on Turkey to comply with its international obligations, as we do with other countries much further away from the European Union, countries with no shared borders with the European Union, where we impose environmental protection clauses.</p>

 I note that questions have been raised here in Parliament on this subject on a number of occasions, and I am afraid I really do not have anything further to add. I do of course agree with Mrs Karamanou that we will use the opportunities which international conventions offer, and it is clear that the obligations contained in the Barcelona Convention will, of course, also apply to Turkey.

 Madam Commissioner, apart from the issue raised by my colleague, Mrs Karamanou, there are two other problems relating to that plant. The first is that, according to the views of Canadian scientists and Turkish professors Mr Kilik and Mr Kantiroglou at the University of Ankara, those reactors, which are Candu reactors from Canada, can represent a very specific method to enrich their nuclear waste with plutonium so that the plant in question becomes a nuclear weapons plant. That is one problem. The second is that both the International Atomic Energy Agency in Vienna and the corresponding commissions in Canada and the United States have severely criticized the quality of the Canadian Candu stations so far as nuclear safety is concerned.</p>
<p class="contents">How can the European Union be providing funds for the closure of the plants in Chernobyl and Koslodui, and not be interested in nuclear reactors which already present problems, as was stressed at the Environment Conference in Kyoto, at which Europe took part and where Argentina and South Korea, countries which have such reactors, decided to close them down for safety reasons.</p>

 Firstly, I would like to suggest to my Greek colleagues that, as they are so worried about the pollution of small industries in Turkey in the Aegean Sea, to see to it that the MEDA programme will apply to Turkey as soon as possible, and that the financial protocol of the Customs Union will be declared applicable by Turkey. Then we will have money to help Turkey. My question to the Commissioner is: is he prepared to include as many of these environmental projects as possible in the MEDA programme?</p>

The authorities in Belgrade believe that the Kosovo issue is an internal affair, and reject every attempt by the international community which aims to lessen the tensions. Time and time again President Milosovic has been urged, by the European Union as well, to proceed to constructive dialogue with the Albanians in Kosovo, in order to reach agreements on a significant degree of autonomy for Kosovo.</p>
<p class="contents">Having a dialogue of this kind is one of the conditions the European Union has set for developing relations with the former Yugoslavia. These conditions laid down in the so‐called regional approach also monitor adequate implementation of the obligations resulting from the Dayton peace agreements, the development of good relations with neighbouring countries, the respect for human rights and the rights of minorities, and the freedom of the press. As long as these criteria are not adequately met, a possible deepening of the relationship is not on the agenda.</p>
<p class="contents">The most recent report on the state of affairs regarding conditionality, at the end of last year, led to the non‐renewal for the time being of the so‐called autonomous trade measures. There is therefore no question of any financial support as part of the PHARE programme.</p>

 Commissioner, I think it is time we tried to put some pressure on Belgrade, as we have done in other cases; for years we have been portrayed as a ridiculous paper tiger, because in contrast to the United States of America we cannot even open an office. Without sanctions, we will not be able to get through this basic request. Also, I do not think it is a question of minority rights, but about restoring autonomy to Kosovo, where 90 % of the population is Albanian. This is not just about human rights: it is about a basic denial of human rights; it is about murder and brutal suppression. Above all, war is likely to break out there soon, and we are not even in a position to open an office which people can turn to in their hour of need, which means that we shall share the responsibility when blood starts to flow there.</p>

 Dialogue between Belgrade and Pristina is vital for a solution in Kosovo. It is this dialogue which has been argued for so strongly at international level with President Milosevic. During the past few months, international pressure has been applied to arrive at such dialogue. I would draw your attention to the French‐German initiative, to the letter from the European Union and the United States to President Milosevic, to the declaration of the PIC Conference in Bonn, and to the establishment of the Working Party on Kosovo by the contact group on 8 January this year.</p>
<p class="contents">An important confidence‐raising measure would be, for example, the implementation of the education agreement signed at the time between Belgrade and Pristina, which the Commission, incidentally, is prepared to support, along with material support, if this were necessary.</p>
<p class="contents">As we maintain no special relations with Belgrade it is extremely difficult to talk about sanctions. Autonomous trade preferences were not renewed last time. What pressure can we exert rather than the initiatives which we have used thus far? That does not mean that I do not agree with Mr Posselt that the situation in Kosovo is exceptionally explosive, could lead very easily to a conflict, and that we will have to do everything we can to help prevent this and continue to think how this is best done. But the practical steps to be taken are not easy ones, particularly since Milosevic still has not met the conditions which were included in the Gonzales report, which are being tested over and over again, and on the basis of which closer relations with Yugoslavia are in fact being rejected.</p>
<p class="contents">Finally, in March, next month in other words, the Commission will send a new report to the Council in which an evaluation will be made of the situation and the developments in the former Yugoslavia, and on the basis of which we will have to reconsider whether more comprehensive measures will be a possibility, be they encouraging measures or sanctions. We will also discuss the situation in Croatia and the situation in Bosnia, and then we will have to see. Again, this answer was not intended in any way to underestimate the concern which Mr Posselt rightly expressed.</p>

 Commissioner, I would first like to say that I am delighted that you have said that we must do everything in our power to help Kosovo, even if our powers are naturally somewhat limited.</p>
<p class="contents">If you consider how critical the situation in Albania is becoming, it is hard to believe things can get any better in Kosovo. The position there is getting worse all the time because of the socialist regime which is adopting positively fascist attitudes and is really becoming a problem. Can you see a connection here, and what can we do in this context?</p>
<p class="contents">My second question is this: if we actually manage to get an EU office for Kosovo – and the will to do so is there – but cannot open it in Pristina for the time being, might it be possible, provisionally at least, to set up the office here, and then move it later directly to Pristina, as soon as we can, so that an office would at least exist to act as a contact for Albanians in Kosovo and to directly look after their interests?</p>

 I do not think Mr Habsburg is doing justice to the position of the Albanian government, particularly as regards the current situation in Kosovo; the Albanian government does not give us any reason whatsoever to assume that it encourages separatist or violent elements in Kosovo. The contrary is true. Our talks with the Albanians, as well as with the Prime Minister, have made it very clear that they feel partly responsible for trying to prevent an explosion in Kosovo. It must be clear that they regret that any dialogue between Belgrade and Pristina is in fact rejected by Belgrade.</p>
<p class="contents">On the subject on the office in Pristina, we regularly receive delegations from Kosovo in Brussels. So I do not really see any sense in opening an office here in Brussels. The issue is really whether a presence in Kosovo itself would make it easier for us to set up programmes, or organize intercommunal programmes. But Kosovo is and remains with its limited, or with an enlarged autonomy, part of Yugoslavia. This means that in order to develop programmes we require at least tolerant support from Belgrade.</p>

<p class="contents">Subject: Construction of a nuclear plant in Turkey</p>
<p class="contents">Turkey is planning to set up nuclear reactors to produce electricity in the Akkuyu region only 477 km from Rhodes and 150 km from Nicosia. These installations represent a great threat to south‐east Europe and western Asia because the area is particularly prone to earthquakes and because of the prevailing winds. Needless to say, there is a risk of a major environmental disaster. Moreover, this plant will cover only 2 % of Turkey's energy requirements.</p>
<p class="contents">Will the Commission therefore intervene immediately, since these reactors represent an environmental hazard to a Member State of the Union and to a state in the process of becoming a member (Cyprus)?</p>
<p class="contents">What steps will the Commission take to adopt rules on trade in nuclear technology?</p>

The installations are situated outside Community territory, and Community regulations are therefore not applicable. Turkey, incidently, did not ask the Community for any financial contributions. The Turkish authorities have launched an international tender for the construction of the plant which was closed on 15 October. Turkey is investigating the quotes from various consortiums at the moment, and the Turkish Minister for Energy announced that the final choice will have to be made in April 1998. From the information gathered by the Commission, it appears that the Turkish authorities opted for Akkuyu after specialized departments from a number of Turkish universities had carried out in‐depth research which focused primarily on seismic, geological and environmental aspects. An evaluation of the nuclear safety aspects of the power station will only be possible once the Turkish authorities have made their choice from the different tenders, when the technology to be used will be determined.</p>

 Commissioner, I am very sorry, but no matter how polite I try to be, I cannot say your answer has satisfied me. Can we discuss Turkey, a country we want to join the European Union and which must reach the appropriate level, and say that the Commission cannot intervene in Turkey, although it is building a nuclear reactor that might produce such damage, and not just in Greece as Mr Eisma said? In that, he is mistaken. The damage caused will extend to the whole of the south‐eastern part of Europe and will reach Asia as well. Let us not forget Koslodui and let us not forget the chemical weapons of a war that is threatening in Iraq, and which can unfortunately reach as far as the Aegean.</p>
<p class="contents">I want to add here that Mrs Bjerregaard's answer also failed to satisfy me, because even in Turkey, where we know how human rights are suppressed, ecological organizations have risen up in protest against the disappearance of many species, such as the <span class="italic">Monachus‐monachus</span>
 seal and others.</p>

 I will answer very briefly, Mr President, because it is not really possible to answer this question while we still do not know what power station is going to be built. There is no ban on the construction of power stations, including those for countries which aspire to join the European Union. So is it not a little premature to call already for a kind of veto before we have any more information about this project, apart from the fact, and I repeat, that the European Union obviously may not make any claim to the actual construction of that power station? But again, once we know more and if the information turns out to be disconcerting, we will be happy to respond to this during out regular contacts with Turkey.</p>

 Mr President, I should start by saying that the Commissioners" speech gives me the feeling that, unfortunately, there is still very little room for dialogue on these directives between the Commission and Council, on the one hand, and Parliament, on the other, and therefore, unfortunately, we cannot find the openings we were expecting. However, I believe, as has been said, that the high number of deaths and serious harm caused by air pollution, largely due to vehicle traffic – think of the damage caused by acid rain – mean that we need clear, fast decisions, even if we are convinced that we cannot solve the problem just by concentrating on petrol and vehicles.</p>
<p class="contents">Other initiatives are in fact needed, such as the introduction of new fuels, with the use of innovative transport systems. But above all, we need initiatives encouraging, for example, group transportation, switching passengers and goods to less polluting means of transport. These are all things that are not included in these measures but which, if not pursued, would make it difficult to achieve the objective.</p>
<p class="contents">With regard to the two directives in question, the Greens certainly share the problems raised by the rapporteurs and the solutions proposed in their reports. We believe, in particular, that the level of sulphur in petrol should be reduced, the quantity of aromatics and polyaromatics reduced to non‐hazardous values, that lead should be totally eliminated and, with regard to vehicle systems, that a system providing on‐board diagnostics should be introduced for all vehicles.</p>
<p class="contents">However, it should certainly not be said that the measures to be taken before 2000 are too soon and should be postponed to 2005 and then say that they are not compulsory: either they are compulsory or they are meaningless!</p>

 Mr President, this afternoon we were talking about the Kyoto Summit and CO<span class="sub">2 </span>
emissions. The debate we are going to have now has a lot to do with what we were talking about this afternoon. In fact, in the Commission"s communication on the Kyoto Summit issued at the end of 1997, reference was made to those sectors which produce the most CO<span class="sub">2</span>
 – one of the most dangerous greenhouse gases – and it was clearly stated that unless measures are taken, CO<span class="sub">2 </span>
emissions from transport will increase by 31 % by 2010. So that is what we are going to talk about now.</p>
<p class="contents">I think the rapporteur has the right approach. He envisages globally integrated measures – in other words, not just using more advanced techniques for engine production, but considering aspects such as better quality fuel, traffic management, the promotion of public transport – which is being neglected –, trans‐European transport networks and alternative fuels. In other words, he proposes a series of integrated measures which are very important to bear in mind.</p>
<p class="contents">The report also says that an improvement in fuel quality would have immediate effects if it were brought in – more so than actual progress in engine production – because it would affect all the cars currently in use in Europe. As the rapporteur rightly says, in some countries – such as my own, Spain – most cars are old and would be very expensive to upgrade.</p>
<p class="contents">Finally, Mr President, I think this Parliament needs a clear majority to approve these reports tomorrow. Parliament will have more say in the codecision process if its position is firm and clear, like the one approved in the Committee on the Environment, Public Health and Consumer Protection.</p>

 Mr President, this Auto‐Oil Programme is nearing its completion. When the standards for 2005 are laid down in a binding way, industry will be given clarification. On that point I fully agree with both rapporteurs. Binding standards for 2005, both for vehicles and fuels, are absolutely necessary. Substantial investments will indeed have to be made, but technically it can all be achieved and it is vital for air quality.</p>
<p class="contents">Only on the point of the NOx<span class="sub"> </span>
catalytic converter, however, is some patience needed. Amendment No 28 which will reduce the sulphur content to 100 ppm in 2000 strikes me as very realistic. Once the catalytic converter is in production, low sulphur fuel should at least also be available.</p>
<p class="contents">I wholeheartedly support the amendments on on‐board diagnostics and cold starts. I also support a durability test after ten years.</p>
<p class="contents">I read that there is some movement on the CO<span class="sub">2 </span>
demands, even though it does not sound particularly positive. Now that the emissions of heavy polluting chemicals have been pushed back considerably, it is all the more pertinent to push back the use of fuel in general, especially since it is being demonstrated that with small technological improvements, large fuel savings can be made. I would draw your attention to the fly wheel vehicle which manages a reduction of 20 %, and the developments in the fivelitre car. Is the Commission considering binding legislation at European level? We believe the time is ripe for this. That way the Kyoto agreements might be achieved.</p>

 Mr President, the dawn of the next millennium will finally see the start of a European road transport policy aimed at combating the problems of air pollution caused by road traffic. If we had to measure its effectiveness, bearing in mind the large number of measures planned, we would certainly be more than optimistic.</p>
<p class="contents">The joint programme drawn up by the Commission and by the motor and oil industries of the Auto‐Oil Union has defined a strategy aimed at reducing vehicle gas emissions to improve air quality, establishing two deadlines: 2000 and 2005, the dates by which the quality of fuels and the limit values of emissions should be defined. With regard to the two reports being discussed, drawn up by Mr Hautala and Mr Lange, the important points of the entire Auto‐Oil programme indicate a subtle contradiction between the fact that improving the quality of fuels will have immediate effects both on new and older vehicles and the fact that establishing limit values and improving engines should, however, only concern new vehicles.</p>
<p class="contents">We would like to establish three priorities: firstly, to combine respect for the environment with respect for work and research in industry; secondly, to establish the final system by 2005; and thirdly, to firmly establish the principle that the “polluter pays’, providing tax incentives for anyone investing with a view to improving quality. It is right that the companies conducting research and making large investments in order to supply a less polluting product should be rewarded.</p>
<p class="contents">We too believe that the marketing of leaded petrol should be prohibited in all Member States by 2000, apart from the fact that this would lead to some economic problems which, we believe, could be prevented by intervening now. In any case, we should start with Council"s decision to fix compulsory values by 2000 and indicative values by 2005.</p>
<p class="contents">With regard to diesel fuel, we accept the proposal made by the Chairman of PSA Citroën‐Peugeot, who recently pointed out the possibility of using biofuels at no extra cost to the motor industry, particularly dister, a highly concentrated, environmentally friendly diesel oil.</p>
<p class="contents">Important factors in the campaign to reduce emissions include: better engine design, better technical control, more frequent inspections and recourse to new types of fuel, together with more attentive management of traffic and public transport. We believe that a whole series of new technologies could be developed to combat pollution effectively: I am referring, for example, to the fitting of on‐board diagnostics systems. We also believe it important to improve on the directive on CO<span class="sub">2</span>
 emissions caused by vehicles, which is currently at a stalemate, together with the proposal to establish a system of tax incentives, that should not mean new taxation but rather an inspection and more effective check of existing ones.</p>

 Mr President, all citizens – not just a select few – have the right to breathe clean air and protect their health. This view, and the increase in air pollution due to our traffic using two fuels, led the European Parliament to vote unanimously at first reading for the amendment to this directive to improve the quality of the air we breathe. The European Parliament"s position and the right to good health, as provided for by the Treaty of Amsterdam, were undeniably echoed by the Council, although that echo is still inadequate since it only takes the form of indicative limit values.</p>
<p class="contents">So we are sure that despite the hard‐hearted pressure to which they have subjected us, some petrochemical companies will make the necessary investments – as the automobile sector has already done – so that they can offer better quality fuels when the health of their shareholders and clients, and of course the citizens as well, forces them to do so.</p>
<p class="contents">It would be a serious matter if private interests were to take precedence over the quality of the air we breathe, especially after the Kyoto Summit. We have all noticed the alarming increase in air pollution in urban areas. Some cities, such as Paris, Athens and Bologna, have even had to ban traffic on occasion in order to provide a solution to this serious health problem. And I think it is important to emphasize that some of these cities are located in the south of the Union.</p>
<p class="contents">Rule 2 of our Rules of Procedure says: “Members of the European Parliament shall exercise their mandate independently. They shall not be bound by any instructions and shall not receive a binding mandate.’ Accordingly therefore, and exercising my own personal responsibility, I shall vote in favour of Mrs Hautala"s report – in favour, that is, of health and the environment.</p>

 Mr President, Madam Commissioner, ladies and gentlemen, although Commissioner Bangemann has already gone, I would not like him to get a surprise in the Conciliation Committee. We are not just talking about the same old proposals for amendments – we too are impressed by how far the Council has moved away from the Commission's position. I think that is a good sign for the conciliation process.</p>
<p class="contents">There is nothing new about attempts to reduce emissions of pollutants from motor vehicles. A lot of progress has been made in recent years, but not enough. Complicated measures will be required to ensure unlimited mobility for our citizens in the future, and that is my particular concern. That is why I welcome the approach adopted in the Auto‐Oil programme before us today. There are two sides to this: first, optimizing vehicle technology so that pollutants are reduced; and second, improving fuel quality so that pollutants are totally eliminated or are reduced, as well as facilitating the introduction of modern engine technology.</p>
<p class="contents">The Auto‐Oil programme was the first time that had happened, and it is unfortunate that the original cooperation between the oil industry and the automotive industry is not continued in the Commission's proposal. It is actually very important for these two European industrial sectors to work together, given that the competitiveness of European industry is at stake. So it has to be reiterated that a legislative approach must be adopted to make progress.</p>
<p class="contents">It is really a truism to say that improved fuels are needed to reduce emissions from the existing motor vehicle fleet and to ease the introduction of fuel‐efficient engine technology in the future. This House made its position on this quite clear at first reading. What I find totally incomprehensible is the attitude of some parts of the European oil industry, which is fighting tooth and nail against significant fuel improvements. It claims that it would involve high costs for the oil industry with little benefit for the environment. Both claims are wrong. The most recent calculations indicate that the cost of desulphurizing fuels and other measures are by no means as high as originally assumed, and it will be passed on to the consumer anyway.</p>
<p class="contents">I would just like to point out what is involved. We are talking about just ECU 0.004 per litre for petrol and 0.009 per litre for diesel, based on the strict limits at first reading. So what are the environmental advantages? They are certainly enormous. One European car manufacturer recently tested its vehicles in California, where fuels that comply with these limits are already on the market. The result was a reduction of about 40 % in hydrocarbon emissions and about 30 % in NOx emissions. I would call that a major environmental benefit.</p>
<p class="contents">It is not fair to threaten refinery closures because of the Auto‐Oil programme. A new Commission study has confirmed what is already well‐known among specialists: there is over‐capacity in Europe's refineries, and this is a structural problem. At present, the oil industry is investing outside Europe. Demand for clean fuels would bring this investment back to Europe and guarantee the competitiveness of this sector in Europe, and that is something we all want.</p>
<p class="contents">Although the compromise proposal is very much a backward step compared with the first reading, I still firmly support it, particularly as regards the mandatory values for 2005. Mr Florenz has already said today that industry has to invest. We know that. It needs to invest money. But we can give it a guarantee that this money will be well invested, instead of letting them invest with 2000 in mind and then suddenly coming up with totally different values, so that their investment has been wasted. We cannot be a party to anything like that, and it is not this Parliament's intention in any case.</p>
<p class="contents">Of course, technically speaking it would be possible to go a lot further than we are proposing here. It remains to be seen whether the legal framework is adequate to achieve everything that is necessary and feasible. If not, the report before us also allows for further improvement. Maybe you will take that as a warning.</p>

I want to thank both of the rapporteurs for their input in this very important area. I also have to declare an interest in this matter because Ireland's only oil refinery is placed in my constituency of Munster, my home county of Cork, and they have approached me with very serious concerns regarding some of the proposals put forward. However, there are a few things that I want to point out.</p>
<p class="contents">Firstly, we must of course – and I think all Members in this Parliament agree – have the best possible environment for each of our citizens to allow them to have full freedom of health and safety. Any actions that we can take here must seek to enforce best practices and ideas.</p>
<p class="contents">Secondly, we also have a duty to ensure that the working environment and the ability to compete and to get a job within our Community is also made available and is as accessible as possible. Looking at some of the suggestions with regard to the maximum levels permitted under the reports, if you just take Ireland as one example, the air quality in Dublin, the capital city, is already meeting the standards that are set down within this report. Cork city, where I come from, is 50 % better than Dublin and the rest of Ireland, rural Ireland we call it, is 10 % better still.</p>
<p class="contents">Surely imposing a European directive and a Europe‐wide legislation will seriously impact on these areas, as Members have already admitted there is a cost factor built into this: costs that will be passed on directly to the consumer and costs that will affect our industrial capacity as well as affecting our competitive edge. To overcome this, Members have suggested that we bring in differential tax incentives to give encouragement and so on. How does this marry with the idea of the single market? Rather than taking up any more time, I would like to say that I will be voting against the reports tomorrow and I hope that through conciliation we can reach a more reasonable suggestion.</p>

 Mr President, our whole present disposable lifestyle is a threat to future generations, and continued automatization poses a threat to climactic stability. Vehicle emissions must be cut by every possible means. Work must be done at their source, with the development of the combustible engine. Fuels must be improved. It is important now to develop viable catalytic convertors for diesel fuels and to improve their quality.</p>
<p class="contents">The European oil industry represents the old smokestack capitalism, based on the exploitation of human beings and the destruction of nature and the environment. The oil industry, though not all companies, opposes limitations on emissions, saying that new investment would have to be found for them. The industry is acting as if it had to meet these new costs itself. We all know, however, that investment always ends up with the consumer having to pay. But it is the polluter who should pay. That would result in just a minute rise in the price of fuel. If the polluter does not pay, it is the people who are getting sick who pay. Even if the European oil industry is not proving competitive, the costs of investment should not get passed on to the consumer. It is the European Parliament"s duty to refuse to ensure the survival of the oil industry by subsidizing poor quality oil. Any oil industry which cannot sell its products except at the cost of the pollution of the natural world deserves to go bust.</p>
<p class="contents">Mr President, I think it is vital that both Mr Lang and Mrs Hautala"s reports be approved. It is important if we wish to improve air quality.</p>

 Mr President, it is important to remember that, basically, the Auto‐Oil programme is about improving the environment and human health. Many studies have shown that air pollution affects people's health. So there is a direct link between increasing mortality and air pollution caused by road traffic. These studies clearly show that clear limits must be set on motor vehicle emissions, and clear standards must be set for petrol quality. This means it is important that the levels should be binding, and not merely indicative. Fixed standards are the only realistic way of achieving the air quality desired. For the same reason, it is important to limit the exceptions to the standards to the absolute minimum necessary. This does not mean, of course, that we should ignore the economic aspects. New technology and higher standards mean increased costs, but the first thing to do is to look at all the relevant variables. Cost‐effectiveness cannot be the only basis for assessing individual mechanisms. We must assess cost‐effectiveness in the light of the improvements and savings to society as a whole. So I agree that the directive's proposals should include the solutions which are best for the citizens" health as well as for the economy.</p>
<p class="contents">Experience from California also shows that the Commission's estimates exaggerate the costs which would be involved in the new petrol quality standards and emission limits. I believe it would encourage innovation if demands were made on industry. Hopefully, the directive concerned will encourage the industry to develop vehicles running on renewable sources of energy. I can therefore heartily support the Council's joint approach to all the amendments the Committee on the Environment has made.</p>

 Mr President, in ecological terms Mrs Hautala and Mr Lange's reports certainly constitute a shining hour in Parliament's history. What might at first sight appear to be a handicap for the automotive industry is in practice a great opportunity. It was the same with the catalytic converter: people originally said it would be the downfall of the car industry, but in fact it resulted in technical progress.</p>
<p class="contents">By sticking to its old position, the Commission is spoiling the prospects for constructive dialogue, which would be a vital opportunity. So the car will remain the number one environmental enemy. The debate about the true costs of road traffic will have to be stepped up. Parliament has offered a solution, but unfortunately it has not been accepted. If there is a confrontation, there will be no winners, neither the environment nor the car or oil industries. There will just be losers, which is a great pity. While Parliament will certainly pass the elk test tomorrow, in my view the Commission has already failed it.</p>

 Mr President, Parliament made the right choice at first reading. It enabled the Commission"s position to be significantly developed since the Council was making somewhat more favourable proposals. We can go further though and this is what our citizens expect. Every day we see in the papers that town pollution is on the increase and that the greenhouse effect is threatening us. It is now imprinted on the collective conscience that we can use technological progress to resolve these problems of civilization, quality of life and health of our people.</p>
<p class="contents">It is therefore essential that restrictive and strict standards be set for the year 2005 because this will be an advantage for the automobile industry. Of course the manufacturers are somewhat hesitant, but they must understand that the credibility of the motor vehicle rests precisely on the possibility of having standards in line with our expectations. It is all the more important that the European automobile market understands one difficulty, that is, the replacement of the stock of cars on the road. Only clean, safe cars can legitimize renewing the number of cars on the road, and thus reviving employment in this sector.</p>
<p class="contents">We also know that the question of cars already on the road, which has been raised by many colleagues, is essential. From this point of view, the efforts demanded of the oil industry are essential, for there are a large number of older cars. I hope that Europe will also consider ways for a speedier removal of older cars from our roads, bearing in mind that they often belong to poorer people. We need a Community strategy to speed up this transformation of the older rolling stock.</p>
<p class="contents">Finally, the environment is not the enemy of employment: the evolution of the car is an opportunity for the car industry! The oil companies, which are blackmailing us over the refineries, have accumulated considerable profits over the years, profits which must be reinvested in order to modernize their industry for the general interest. They must not then hide behind the environmental question to justify the closures which they had – unfortunately – planned, whatever we decide today.</p>

 Mr President, we in Parliament can note with pleasure that the Council has tightened up the Commission's original proposal on important points and moved in the direction of Parliament's position. On the other hand, the majority on the Committee on the Environment, Public Health and Consumer Protection supported Mrs Hautala's modifications concerning fuel. These amendments were sensible considering the short time remaining until implementation in the year 2000.</p>
<p class="contents">It is important to stimulate technical development towards more advanced exhaust gas purification technology and towards more fuel‐efficient engines by guaranteeing access to fuel with a very low sulphur content until the year 2005. During the transition period we would then also see a substantial improvement with regard to emissions from older vehicles. This is quite simply a short cut to better air quality. On the other hand, I think that the Committee on the Environment has gone too far with regard to aromatics in petrol in the year 2000. On this point I think the Council has a more realistic approach.</p>
<p class="contents">In a large number of modern refineries there is a conflict between sulphur requirements and aromatics requirements. From the environmental point of view the sulphur requirement is much more important and should therefore be given priority. In addition, modern catalytic converter technology takes care of the aromatics.</p>
<p class="contents">It is also important for Member States to be allowed to take a lead and to have the right to use economic means of control to improve the environment. In large parts of Sweden a fuel is used which meets the requirements being made for the year 2005. I can guarantee that the environment has been manifestly improved where this fuel has been used. It is also easy to use economic means of control and to prevent them from being used in such a way that competition is restricted.</p>
<p class="contents">Finally, it is pleasing to note that the development towards cars with zero emissions is moving so quickly. We can see them, not only as a vision, but also as a reality.</p>

 Mr President, the European Parliament will today give its opinion on two proposals for directives in which there is a considerable amount at stake, for the environment, for industry and for employment.</p>
<p class="contents">Our position must therefore achieve a fair balance between the desire to improve air quality and to promote new technologies, as well as our desire to maintain competitiveness and employment in the European vehicle and oil industries.</p>
<p class="contents">You will tell me it is a little like squaring the circle, and I would like to make a number of observations. Firstly, reasonable time limits must be defined to allow industry to adapt to the new standards. Secondly, we need to know if controls greater than those strictly necessary would not cause exactly the opposite effects to the ones we are hoping for, in particular an increase in cars, thus provoking an ageing of the cars on the road and a worsening of pollution and safety risks, along with economic difficulties for the manufacturers.</p>
<p class="contents">The Council"s position already seemed to be an improvement in relation to that of the Commission. Parliament is calling for more severe standards and it seems as though some of them can be accepted by the Council. It is therefore possible to find a satisfactory balance which is not maximalist and which shows that Parliament knows how to fulfil its responsibilities, both at environmental and industrial level.</p>

 Mr President, economic arguments have long prevailed in debates on this subject. On the one hand, the oil industry, with highly disparate technical and financial conditions between the countries of the South and North and, on the other, the automobile industry, bombard us with their arguments.</p>
<p class="contents">We, however, would like to concentrate on the issue of the environment and public health. Air quality is essential to public health: 7 to 10 % of cases of respiratory disease in children and 19 % of cases of pulmonary illnesses are but a few figures that may be attributed to air pollution. It has been proved that the excessively high concentrations of particles in the air originating from lead reduce children"s intelligence levels.</p>
<p class="contents">In some European capitals, the speed limit is reduced in response to air pollution, when traffic is not banned completely. We wish here to demonstrate and express our support for the position of the Committee on the Environment because this problem also exists in southern Europe. But we would like to concentrate primarily on three main points.</p>
<p class="contents">Firstly, we must combat leaded petrol: it must urgently be eliminated. The Union and Member States should launch a major information campaign to make citizens aware of the environmental advantages of unleaded petrol.</p>
<p class="contents">Secondly, we need to defending the establishment of binding emission values by the year 2005, contrary to the position of the Council and of the oil industry, because this is the only way to seriously commit the industry to an environmental contract with society as a whole.</p>
<p class="contents">Finally, in our view, the role of the European Parliament now, as at first reading, is to raise the benchmark vis‐ŕ‐vis the original proposal. We should also leave the matter of maximum values for sulphur emission for negotiation with the Council, during conciliation procedures. This is because we acknowledge that there are cases, such as in Portugal, where the absence of environmental investment in the sector has caused the postponement of reforms that are today proving to be unavoidable.</p>

 Mr President, we face a challenge here today. Can Parliament coherently defend public health and the environment, maintaining the values of the quality of fuels and continuing to call for better technology in motor vehicles, as stated in the Hautala and Lange reports adopted by the Committee on the Environment? Or will we give in to the numerous pressures from the economic sectors involved?</p>
<p class="contents">I do not dispute that what we are requesting here implies financial and research efforts by the oil and automobile industries.</p>
<p class="contents">But it cannot be denied that air pollution in our cities, including Lisbon and Oporto, frequently reaches levels that threaten public health, and that recent studies confirm that the lead content in children"s blood in risk zones and in urban areas exceeds admissible levels. There is no doubt that particles, benzine, and other pollutants produced by automobile combustion are highly cancerogenic.</p>
<p class="contents">Therefore, we need better cars and better fuels, particularly in view of the fact that no significant technological improvement is possible with the current content of sulphur in petrol and diesel. This is true both for the introduction of a new generation of catalytic converters, or a new generation of engines, such as direct injection for petrol, which has significantly lower consumption which can fall below 25 % in the urban cycle. Lower consumption means lower spending for consumers, less pollution and less CO<span class="sub">2</span>
 emissions – the main gas responsible for climate change. Hence, the calculated annual costs of ESC 1 000 per motor vehicle, and ESC 1 800 per diesel vehicle may not even apply, as a result of the technological evolution leading to the production of better cars with lower consumption.</p>
<p class="contents">It should also be emphasized that better fuels immediately mean less pollution, since even today"s cars will function better and produce lower emissions.</p>
<p class="contents">The individual cases of CEPSA, REPSOL and PETROGAL cannot force the whole of Europe, and particularly the Spanish and Portuguese populations, to continue to breath health‐threatening, polluted air. If these companies experience particular problems, then it is up to their respective governments to negotiate covenants with them which define time frames and mechanisms. As a Member of Parliament, I am ready to analyse with an open mind any requests for derogation that may be submitted to me. However, I cannot hesitate in defending the Huatala and Lange reports which are the only possible way of reconciling conflicting interests in a manner which allows this Parliament democratically to state its position in defending the rights of Europe"s citizens.</p>

 Mr President, although we aim, reasonably and justifiably, to lessen the need for traffic, especially car traffic, in transport and regional planning, the unpleasant truth is that the number of cars in Europe, and more particularly globally, is going to grow. This means increased risk to vulnerable nature and people"s health. Against this background the Auto‐Oil programme is most welcome.</p>
<p class="contents">The European Parliament at first reading clearly took a more progressive position than the Commission on which targets for exhaust emissions should be met by the years 2000 and 2005. Only binding targets on emissions are valid. The recommendations of the Council do not put enough pressure on the European oil industry to develop their technology to produce better and cleaner products. Nor has the Council yet understood the power of tax incentives, which encourage consumers to use better quality fuel. In any case, this has already happened, and with good results.</p>
<p class="contents">Employment is an issue in Europe. Slowing down the adoption of cleaner technology will not serve to aid employment. It might go the other way. Consumer demand favours those refineries which make environmentally friendly products. Unless these products are available in Europe, other companies and products from outside may come to dominate European markets. The effects on employment of this are unfathomable. We must ensure that we remain competitive and that oil products in Europe are of the highest quality.</p>

 Mr President, we are all concerned about air quality. Now we are asking the vehicle and oil industries to make an effort.</p>
<p class="contents">Let us look first at the vehicle manufacturers. For the past thirty years we have been asking them to make significant efforts, and they have contributed some 90 % to the improvement of air quality in terms of their vehicles" emissions. Now we are asking them to comply with even more stringent controls. I am more in favour of the common position, considering that the constraints imposed it are already significant. In my opinion the figures must be made compulsory so that our industries can be clear on the issue and define their strategies for development accordingly. I therefore believe that it is particularly important that the measures be made compulsory by the year 2005.</p>
<p class="contents">But technological developments in the area of car manufacture will not be able to truly bear fruit unless there is a manifest improvement in the quality of fuel. In this respect, it is absolutely necessary that the oil companies make the necessary efforts. Up until now, it is not they who have participated most in the improvement of air quality. It is thus important that the oil companies make an effort to reduce the level of sulphur, amongst other things. We know it is essential for the nitrogen oxide catalytic converter, and in my opinion this is particularly important. That is why I wish to support fully and vote for the Hautala report, because it seems to me completely incoherent to call for efforts from the vehicle industry and not to ask for significant efforts on the part of the oil industry in order to make the new technologies completely effective.</p>
<p class="contents">That is all I wanted to say. May I add that if fuel is improved, we will immediately see the short‐term effects, since this will concern all vehicles and we will immediately note improvements in air quality.</p>

 Mr President, Madam Commissioner, the car is part of our freedom. We do not want to give it up, and the car is essential for our economy. But it is a very young means of transport, still at the beginning of its life cycle. For me, it is fascinating what the car industry is already capable of. The competition to get a better and more environmentally friendly car on the market first, the car of the future, is enormous. However, it is certainly not our job as Members of Parliament to protect the automotive industry in its efforts to produce cars despite the impact on the market and the health of our population.</p>
<p class="contents">I also find it fascinating that Renault's exhaust gas expert, Mr Hublain, is calling on this Parliament to adopt stricter requirements for petrol and diesel. Better fuels are the key to reducing emissions, and we must give them our wholehearted support.</p>
<p class="contents">The oil companies are worried about their high investments. For one thing, the fuels Parliament wants to see already exist in various countries. No‐one denies they will involve greater investment, but the oil companies' balance sheets are remarkably healthy; they are making enormous profits. I am sure they can take these investments in their stride.</p>
<p class="contents">To avoid any misunderstandings, I have nothing against large international companies or anyone else making big profits, but it is our job to look after our population's health, and it is also one of the Community's declared objectives.</p>
<p class="contents">As Members of Parliament, we are bound to implement the duties of the Community as laid down in the treaties. We will have a chance to put this into practice in tomorrow's vote.</p>

<img align="absmiddle" alt="" src="/doceo/data/img/arrow_summary.gif"/>  <span class="doc_subtitle_level1_bis">Jackson </span> <span class="bold">(PPE).</span> – Mr President, this debate has been something of a battle between the vehicle and the oil industries to woo the European Parliament to one or other side. I regret that because the position is rather more complicated by the chemistry of this Parliament itself. It has to be recognized that the European Parliament has built up – and we see this in the persons of our rapporteurs – a certain expertise in this field. Parliament is reluctant to abdicate a role in the conciliation process which we would do if we simply said ‚fine’ to the common position. I would ask you to remember that this is the last open debate to be had on these subjects before they disappear into the Conciliation Committee.</p>
<p class="contents">I and my British Conservative colleagues are likely to support the Hautala amendments but we have our doubts over some of those proposed by Mr Lange. We accept that there are some Lange amendments which require changes in vehicle production that would be very difficult if not impossible to bring about within the accelerated time scale proposed. On the other hand, we see the Hautala amendments as likely to bring about improvements quite rapidly which will affect all vehicles on the road and not simply the very new ones.</p>
<p class="contents">However, I want to sound an alarm over the question of leaded petrol. We should not look kindly on legislation that, on the one hand, says that all leaded petrol will be banned from 1 January 2000 and then also says that where a country can plead socioeconomic difficulties this ban will not have to apply until the year 2005. This kind of thing makes it very difficult to argue that we all care equally about Europe's environment. In some of our more crowded ancient cities enormous damage is being done to people's health by emissions from leaded petrol engines. The let‐out clause for such countries would allow this to continue for another seven years.</p>
<p class="contents">We welcome the ban from January 2000 but we owe it to the millions of people who own cars that run on leaded petrol to tell them what happens then. In Britain there will be 1.3 million cars at least still on the road in 2000 that were designed to run on leaded petrol. Imagine the headlines: ’Brussels drives us off the road’.</p>
<p class="contents">It is now up to the oil industry and to the governments in the countries which have no contingency plan to find some way out to offer people who own these cars, either through the marketing of lead additives or through the marketing of re‐formulated petrol. We owe it to these people and the Commission, national governments and the European Parliament should come up with some solution for them.</p>

 Mr President, Commissioners, the citizens of Europe are rightly asking to be able to breathe clean air in their cities, and the Auto‐Oil programme, which the European Parliament is preparing to vote on at second reading, proposes a global strategy for trying to achieve specific air quality objectives, in line with the recommendations of the World Health Organization.</p>
<p class="contents">We are faced with two very important measures that will certainly have an impact on the environment as well as on the industrial strategies of our countries: the Hautala report proposes to establish new regulations on petrol by the years 2000‐2005, particularly as regards the percentage of reduction in petrol, aromatic products and sulphur contained in fuels, that are causing serious illnesses such as cancer; and the Lange report proposes to make certain modifications to engines by those same dates, providing them, for example, with a special on‐board diagnostics system (OBD) to control the limit values for emissions.</p>
<p class="contents">According to the Lange report, the motor industry is therefore required, in a realistic and technically feasible space of time, to adapt to the specific limits laid down by the directive while, with the Hautala report, we can go further than the common position, maintaining the modifications introduced by the Committee on the Environment, aimed mainly at establishing stricter limits for petrol and diesel.</p>
<p class="contents">Italy, in anticipation of the Community directive, has imposed severe limits for some time on petrol (1 %), aromatics (35 %) and oxygenized products (2.7 %) and, apart from several problems with sulphur and lead – for which stricter limits should be achieved by 2005 – has certainly the best petrol in Europe today.</p>
<p class="contents">I hope that these directives, improved by Parliament during conciliation, are approved and come into effect as soon as possible.</p>

 Mr President, ladies and gentlemen, at the end of a long list of speakers, including many from my group, it is up to me to say something new. That is not an easy task, but I think I can manage. First of all, I would like to set out the position of the Group of the European People's Party. Some differences certainly emerged in this debate. It has been quite a struggle, but I can inform you that my group is in favour of the Lange report and the Hautala report.</p>
<p class="contents">We have not been able to support all the details. However, we are first and foremost in favour of mandatory values for 2005 in both reports, and I think that is the key issue. I am glad that we have achieved this result and that we will therefore be giving this our 314 votes at tomorrow's sitting.</p>
<p class="contents">I would like to make a comment now on competition. I believe it is right that we have discussed the competitiveness of German industry and industry in other Member States; it is also right that these industries have presented the problems to us and that we are looking at this in a global European context. But there is an important difference between this and our normal debates. We often burden our industry with conditions that other players on the world market do not have to comply with, which therefore restricts competition. This case is totally different, because if a company or a refinery outside the EU wants to sell petrol within the EU, it has to comply with our conditions. So it is not a question of a distortion of competition that will push up our production costs, but rather a sensible means of protecting the environment and enhancing our capacity for innovation.</p>
<p class="contents">Finally, I would like to make a comment to the Commission. I am sorry that Mr Bangemann is not with us. I would like to say this to him personally, but you can pass it on to him, Mrs Bjerregaard. We have a new European Union health policy, thanks to this Parliament. Even Mr Bangemann changed his view. He brought forward some good proposals on baby food and the labelling of maize and soya. Please tell him that we would be delighted if he decided to share Parliament's viewpoint. Perhaps that will make him realize what is needed, and enable us to get a really good result in the Conciliation Committee.</p>

 Mr President, I would simply like to say thank you for the debate. I think it has been exciting to listen to all the contributions on the problems this report raises. It has also been clear to the Commission that there has been considerable support for the reports by Mr Lange and Mrs Hautala. All we can do now is await the vote tomorrow and prepare ourselves to begin conciliation procedures. I can only say that I hope we can get this started quickly. I think the proposals deserve our unanimity so they can be applied in real life. As I see during the debate today, we are at any rate agreed on the goals, and so it should be possible to achieve a result within a reasonable period of time. So thank you for the debate.</p>

. – Mr President, the Agency regulation which we are, I hope, going to conclude this evening, entered into force in October 1993. I do not need to go into the history of it. It was a fairly vexed history at the time. At the time it provided for a review of the regulation two years later. However, the review itself was then postponed for a further two years to allow it to be a fully operational Agency. If it had happened earlier it would not have been operational.</p>
<p class="contents">The Commission proposal, when it came, was fairly uncontroversial and the aim of the amendments to the proposal is to strengthen existing provisions and thereby allow the Agency to consolidate its work to date. However, I think a lot of people still do not understand what the functions of the Agency are. That came through very clearly indeed when we were discussing it in committee. I would like, therefore, tonight, to lay out the aims of the Agency and then describe how my amendments will further them.</p>
<p class="contents">The key reason for setting up the Environment Agency in the first place was to facilitate the collection of comparable environmental data across the Community, across the whole of Europe, indeed. Until the establishment of the Agency we had no way of comparing the state of each nation's environment, and yet comparable data are clearly a prerequisite for an effective environment policy. Quite simply put, the Member States all collected environmental data, but you could not compare Spain with Portugal; you could not compare Portugal with Greece, nor Greece with Germany, nor Germany with the United Kingdom. So we could not have an overall view of the state of the environment in the Community. That was the reason, in the first instance, for setting up the Agency. The long‐term aim is for the Commission to use the data supplied to the Agency to help monitor the state of the European Union environment and also to implement environment policies more effectively.</p>
<p class="contents">The Commission reviews the Agency performance to date. Basically its review is pretty favourable. It suggests some new areas for Agency action and, broadly speaking, is in favour of further increased cooperation between the Agency itself and third countries, particularly those in central and eastern Europe. We very much welcome that, with the prospect of enlargement looming.</p>
<p class="contents">However, there are certain gaps in the review. I have attempted to fill these with my amendments to the report. For instance, the Commission proposal overlooks the very important role of Parliament. It says very little about it. It tends to over‐emphasize the role played by the Commission and the Council. I can understand why that happens, but I think it is right that we should correct it.</p>
<p class="contents">I also feel that the Agency and the Commission need to put in place a framework in order to facilitate greater cooperation between them and avoid duplication of each other's work. The Commission should not be doing work that is being done by the Agency, and the Agency should not be doing work that is being done by the Commission. We have tried to clarify that. As the Agency plays a key role as information gatherer in the Community in order to aid the Commission's implementation and enforcement of legislation, it should be encouraged to cooperate more with bodies such as IMPEL because enforcement and implementation are key features of the development of environment policy in the Community. It is clear that in order to provide information to the general public the Agency needs to publish documents in more languages, wherever possible. That is one of the reasons why I fully support, for example, Mrs Díez de Rivera Icaza's amendment.</p>
<p class="contents">I believe that the provision of the repository of information and a data register will allow the Agency to disseminate information better to the general public. That is also a very important feature of environment policy in the Community.</p>
<p class="contents">Finally, if we are going to require the Agency, and we do, to produce a multi‐annual work programme, then that has to be complemented by a multi‐annual budget. To do one without the other, I think, and the committee believes this, is entirely inconsistent. That final point is very important because the key challenge faced by the Agency in the view of the Committee on the Environment, Public Health and Consumer Protection over the coming years will be the budgetary challenge.</p>
<p class="contents">Ladies and gentlemen, we would do well to note that simply because the Agency has not had its functions considerably expanded does not mean that it should have its budget frozen or reduced. We need to consolidate its work. This, after all, is an Agency that contributes significantly to European Union policy and could contribute even more significantly in the future. Therefore it needs a degree of autonomy. It requires the support of Parliament behind it.</p>
<p class="contents">The Agency needs to consolidate its work to date and then be allowed to expand if and when necessary. But it can only do that if it receives the right budget. Frankly, some of the attitudes displayed in some of the amendments that we received from one important committee of Parliament did not suggest that anybody really understood that properly. This is a functional Agency. It is not a think‐tank. It is necessary for the Community. It is a functional part of the Community and needs to be treated as such.</p>

. – Mr President, this report is part of a five‐year review of the European Environment Agency which is based in Copenhagen. The aim of the Commission review is to decide if the agency's status and tasks need upgrading. Obviously the nature and substance of its work is more a matter for the Committee on the Environment, Public Health and Consumer Protection than for the Committee on Budgets.</p>
<p class="contents">In the light of the financial constraints which apply right across the whole of the European Union, the budgetary implications for this agency are fundamental to its future. Before I go any further I should like to congratulate the Director and staff of the Environment Agency on the way in which they have managed successfully to implement the objectives set out in the founding regulation and to express my appreciation of the way in which the agency has supported Parliament's moves towards transparency and accountability and the harmonization of the regulations.</p>
<p class="contents">The draft report by Mr Collins has taken over one of the three amendments tabled by the Committee on Budgets, the one on Article 1(6). The initiative recommended by this amendment will provide Parliament, as the political and budgetary authority, with the right to evaluate for the first time the cost‐effectiveness of the environmental policy of the Union. The tasks which are decentralized and executed by a satellite body and the activities run at a centralized level by the Commission need to be clearly defined in order to ensure complementarity and to avoid duplication.</p>
<p class="contents">On the other hand, Parliament has stated clear principles for all the agencies within the 1998 procedure. Since the budget and the establishment plan are published in the budget and therefore belong to budgetary remarks, any change to them needs to be communicated to the budgetary authority. The Committee on Budgets has been consistent with the Parliament's decision and has tabled its Amendment No 1 in this sense. This was an opportunity to enable the Environment Agency to draw down resources for alternative budget lines and could have helped the agency to receive extra payments for rented services as its basic regulation allows, provided transparency is assured.</p>
<p class="contents">If the Environment Committee had maintained this amendment it would have given legislative coverage to that budgetary position. We are sad that this has not been taken up. The Committee on Budgets is also concerned about the annuality of the budget process in the Environment Committee's Amendment No 8. In the same way, between the link between the work programme and the approved budget, there is now a horizontal principle adopted by Parliament which applies to all agencies and which gives them some sense of flexibility to make a selection of their priorities. Therefore, the Committee on Budgets has introduced this principle in the legislative proposal.</p>

 Mr President, there can be no doubt that we think the Environment Agency in Copenhagen has made a good start to its activities. We now hope that with these opinions we can make the Environment Agency even better.</p>
<p class="contents">The starting point for the Committee on Research has partly been to not demand too many changes, since the Environment Agency has just started many of its new tasks. However, we have proposed some minor changes.</p>
<p class="contents">The Agency's task is to provide us with information about environmental policy so that we can conduct a good environmental policy. We on the Committee on Research think there should be a unit within the Environment Agency to check the quality of data and assess the uncertainty in the material collected from the various countries. The main task of this unit would be to continuously monitor the quality of the data being offered and to be expressly responsible for identifying and describing the uncertainty which there is in much of the data collected. In addition, the unit should also have the authority to question the national data collected, and be given sufficient resources, if appropriate, to seek and obtain alternative information. It is only with relevant information that we can make the necessary and right decisions in the environmental sector.</p>
<p class="contents">Within the Environment Agency a great deal of expertise about the environmental area has also been built up. It would therefore be a great mistake if this environmental expertise was not used. Consequently, the Committee on Research recommends that the Environment Agency should not only do work to order, for example where giving advice and expert opinions are concerned, but that it should also be able to initiate various projects itself.</p>
<p class="contents">In addition, it is, of course, important for us to be able to disseminate the information which the Environment Agency collects so that everyone is able to use it, not least the general public and non‐governmental organizations, the research community, students, etcetera, in order to make the material and thus the EU's environmental policy as good as possible in future.</p>

 Mr President, for us, the Members involved in the struggle to create and establish the European Environment Agency, nothing is more satisfying than the Collins report on the assessment and revision of that Agency"s responsibilities. As Mr Collins shows, in the short time it has been in existence the Agency has amply fulfilled the objectives established by the then President of the Commission, Jacques Delors. It has accurately and competently provided objective, comparable information on the environmental situation in Europe, so that Parliament, the Commission and the Member States can all respond appropriately.</p>
<p class="contents">Having said that, I just want to spend a moment on one aspect of the new responsibilities: the area of strengthening its information function. In other words, whenever possible, the Agency should try to issue its publications in all the official languages of the European Union, as Mr Collins said. Otherwise, the valuable work the Agency does to spread information would be diminished, and it would cease to fulfil its main objective.</p>
<p class="contents">I realize, Mr President, that that involves extra expense. But the cost of environmental damage is greater, and one of the objectives of the European Environment Agency is to prevent that very damage, as I said a moment ago. An amendment has been presented on this point and I hope the Commission and the Council will see fit to accept it.</p>

 Mr President, Madam Commissioner, ladies and gentlemen, of course the European Environmental Agency wasted a lot of time at the beginning, because it was three years until its location was decided. We are still making up for that lost time. Nevertheless, despite all the problems that entailed, the Agency has done some very good functional work, which I would particularly like to acknowledge here.</p>
<p class="contents">However, it is also true to say that the amendments to the regulation on the establishment of the European Environmental Agency essentially reflect the functional requirements that have since become apparent, and that only limited changes in its role are envisaged. The planned widening of the Agency's role relates to supporting the Commission in monitoring environmental impact and in producing reports, disseminating information on environmental research and setting up a repository of environmental information.</p>
<p class="contents">We also particularly welcome the proposal that the Agency should support the Commission as regards the reports. The objective of involving the Agency in reports must, however, be to avoid duplication in cases when the Commission and the Agency separately request data and reports from Member States. We also need to ensure that the Commission and the Agency act on the basis of the same sets of data.</p>
<p class="contents">In monitoring the work of the EEA we need to put special emphasis on the need, as a long‐term objective, to harmonize national environmental information systems with the European environment information and observation network; to ensure close coordination between the Agency and the Member States on the subject and methods of data acquisition; and lastly, to make sure that we do not create data cemeteries by gathering and archiving unwanted and useless data.</p>
<p class="contents">On a formal note, I must once again criticize the Commission for not presenting a consolidated proposal, which made the discussions Mr Collins led considerably more difficult.</p>

It is very good and I congratulate the Commission also on that. I am bound to say that, until we get some helicopters in the Agency and introduce the concept of people coming from Copenhagen to put matters right, with those helicopters descending upon areas of serious environmental damage, then nobody is going to take it that seriously. But if we saw a helicopter they would and I am not being entirely silly about this because, although I have had this debate with my colleagues in the Environment Committee, I am conscious that our aspirations for the Agency are completely different from that what has been set up.</p>
<p class="contents">As Mrs Schleicher said, it is a tame cemetery for data, that is not really good enough. What we should be aspiring to – and it would necessarily mean a change in the status and the statute of the Agency – is an Agency which is capable of carrying out international inspection. That means paying serious attention to the issue of enforcement which sadly, at the moment, is overlooked. We do not have the mechanism by which environmental law and policy can be enforced throughout the Union partly because that is still done by the nation‐states.</p>
<p class="contents">Nobody is going to respect nation‐state agencies; they would however respect, in my view, an Agency which was international in composition and was an inspectorate of inspectorates. That is a long way away and perhaps we should not be making that kind of assessment of the Agency work so far, but unless somebody says from time to time that those should be the aspirations of the Agency, then it was surely not worthwhile Copenhagen putting up the understandable fight that it did to have the institution based there.</p>

 Mr President, Madam Commissioner, the decision in 1990 to found a scientifically independent European Environment Agency for the collection, processing and analysis of environmental data at a European level was an important development in the attempt to work out a credible and coherent policy for the environment sector in the European Union.</p>
<p class="contents">Four years after that Agency began operating, we are called upon, on the basis of experiences and appraisals, to approve amendments in its founding regulation that will improve its work. The main aim of the amendments must be to extend and assist the collection and processing of reliable facts and figures, and especially the provision of information both to the institutional bodies and to the Member States for the elaboration of measures and policies. We therefore favour improved information and the formation of links between the Agency's work and the Community's institutional bodies, especially a stronger link between the Agency and the European Parliament. This is because Parliament's contribution to the preparation of policy guidelines and its participation in the process of legislation play a definitive and continually increasing role in the final formulation of environmental policy in the European Union. The Commission should not overlook that fact. Besides, we must stress that the policy of broader information dissemination via networks and telematic applications to all the decision‐making centres, and to the wider public, will also contribute positively towards the appraisal of solutions and help make people aware of the justification and use of environmentally friendly technologies.</p>
<p class="contents">We know that the correct application of Community law is today the Achilles' heel of environment protection policy in the European Union. The Agency can play an important part in collecting data and monitoring compliance with Community law once the use of the IMPEL network has been reinforced and extended. We are in favour of the Agency incorporating support for the Commission in the process of information exchange and the development of criteria for the assessment of environmental impact into its duties, since important problems have emerged in all the Member States due to the incorrect application of that directive. The amendments proposed are, I believe, necessary if the Agency's valuable work is to continue at European level, especially with the challenges the European Union will be facing when the forthcoming enlargement takes place.</p>

<img align="absmiddle" alt="" src="/doceo/data/img/arrow_summary.gif"/>  <span class="doc_subtitle_level1_bis">Bjerregaard, </span> <span class="italic">Member of the Commission. – (DA)</span>
 Mr President, may I start by thanking the European Parliament for having put this amendment to the regulations on the Environmental Agency on the agenda. I think it is important that we get these proposals passed as soon as possible, so that the Agency can start working under its new operating conditions. I would also like to thank Ken Collins, the rapporteur, for the work which has gone into the report.</p>
<p class="contents">The Agency has got off to a good start, and its work is progressing well, as has been emphasized in the debate here. This is gratifying, and I know that Parliament thinks the Agency is very important. In the public debate, we have also been very pleased by the reports which the Agency has published, so we must continue to push on. And let me start by pointing out an important opportunity for development. It is vital that the Agency comes to play a role in the development of central and eastern Europe. We must ensure that the countries which so desire can be involved in the Agency's work, as Mr Collins, the rapporteur, also emphasized.</p>
<p class="contents">I think the rapporteur's amendments are very positive, and I am very pleased at the constructive comments on the Commission's proposals. Amendment No 1 concerns the Agency's support for developing and implementing environmental policy. The Commission accepts both the proposal to return to the original wording of the regulations and references to other EU institutions. Nor is there any problem with the reference to the schedule of work. So we are agreed that there will be close cooperation, and we will work towards that.</p>
<p class="contents">Amendment No 2 states that the information records as proposed are to include a data register. The Commission supports this, but I have been informed that there may be some legal obstacles to the subsequent text on reporting on the Community and national legislation and so we will have to look at this more closely. The amendment also refers to enforcement, and this really takes us back to previous debates. The Agency's main role is to provide the institutions of the Community and Member States with information on what is happening with our environment. This can be achieved by working closely with Member States. If we start to mix the information role with an enforcement role and incorporate this in the regulations, we risk undermining the cooperation and hence the effectiveness of the Agency. In fact, this may mean that we risk not getting the information we need, and that also makes it clear that I do not share the view which Ian White expressed in his contribution. I do not feel we should include enforcement in the Agency's tasks, because it is assumed that the conclusions which the Agency reaches on the environmental situation will tell us more about whether our legislation and mechanisms are being effective. And, as Parliament knows, I have not been backward when it comes to enforcement.</p>
<p class="contents">Amendments Nos 3 and 6 are useful proposals which the Commission accepts. As far as Amendment No 4 is concerned, we can only accept the wording that the Agency will ensure that environmental information is widely distributed if we can add a note to the effect that, in particular, this includes information on the environmental situation. This will help focus work on the Agency's skills and knowledge without preventing work in other fields. We accept the demand for enabling the use of all official languages which both Mr Collins and Mrs Diez de Rivera wanted. However, we think the reference to a new article 2.14 is superfluous.</p>
<p class="contents">As far as Amendment No 5 is concerned, the legal department informs us that Parliament's proposals should not propose amendments to articles which have already been amended in the Commission's proposals. Having said that, we can support the point on IMPEL which Mr Collins also brought up today, and I can tell you that cooperation is already in place, as was confirmed at the last IMPEL meeting. I can also state that the Council's environmental working party is considering how this specific reference can be included in the regulations.</p>
<p class="contents">Amendment Nos 7 and 8 are understandable, but we believe they are unnecessary. Finally, as regards Amendment No 9, we can support the comment that the next audit of the Agency's work should be carried out as part of developing the EU's environmental policy in general. The Agency can help us considerably by establishing itself as an independent, objective supplier of reliable information: this could be on greenhouse gas emissions, coolant tanks and so on. In view of this, I cannot rule out assessing profitability, and the Commission's proposals therefore include a demand for an assessment of results and effectiveness in 1999. However, profitability will be examined in terms of the Agency's own targets, roles and results and not in any wider context such as the Commission's targets.</p>
<p class="contents">Finally, I would like to say that we can also accept the comment in Amendment No 9 that Parliament should also receive the audit report by 15 September 1999, and I would like to end by giving my thanks once more for the debate we have had today and thanking Mr Collins, the rapporteur, for all the work on the proposals. Once again, the focus has been on the Agency's work, and that is good.</p>

 Mr President, eight and a half years ago this House debated the implementing directive on ‚the irradiation of foodstuffs’. We decided at that time, and for very good reasons, to allow only herbs and spices to be irradiated. It then took the Council eight and a half years to reach agreement on a common position. An implementing directive for herbs and spices has been published, and a corresponding framework directive. We are now in the absurd situation of having a framework directive at second reading, without it having had a first reading, which in turn means that according to the President's ruling we cannot table any new amendments, because we did not table any at first reading. Things are getting positively Kafkaesque. Admittedly, we did not table any amendments on the control process and the standardized analysis process, but there was no way we could do that, for one thing because there was no framework directive which they might have formed part of. What is even worse, these processes did not even exist! How could this House demand something that did not exist at that time?</p>
<p class="contents">Of course no‐one is arguing with the idea that we need a common regime, because irradiation is allowed in some Member States and banned in others. We have no regime, so we have no labelling requirements, which means that consumers have absolutely no idea if something is irradiated or not. But they must have a choice, a chance to choose, because it is well known that irradiation destroys vitamins. Consumers think they are buying fresh fruit, but it is not fresh fruit at all – it has the same nutritional value as deep‐frozen or bottled fruit.</p>
<p class="contents">Nor does anyone deny that some nutritional value is lost. No‐one denies that toxicological changes take place whose effects we know nothing about. It is also worth asking why irradiation is needed at all. World hunger is then offered as a justification. Fair enough, but should we buy fruit and vegetables by the tonne to support the market, and simultaneously irradiate fruit and vegetables to make them last longer? There is something not quite right there!</p>
<p class="contents">Anyway, we are scarcely going to reduce world hunger and feed the starving masses by irradiating frogs legs, prawns, shrimps, mussels and so forth. I believe, and I am sure that you will agree with me here, that it should only be permissible to irradiate food for preservation if it is safe healthwise, if it is essential for consumers, and if we can detect that it has been irradiated, otherwise there is no point in having labelling at all. If we cannot detect that food has been irradiated, no‐one is going to put it on the label, because it is highly likely that consumers would then be put off buying it.</p>
<p class="contents">Furthermore, the Committee on the Environment, Public Health and Consumer Protection has ensured that Parliament will play a part in general terms at least with regard to the forthcoming positive list under Article 100a. It used to be the Standing Committee on Foodstuffs, which as we all know meets undemocratically behind closed doors, so that we would have been kept totally in the dark. For all the reasons that I have just explained, I implore you to accept the amendments proposed by the Committee on the Environment, Public Health and Consumer Protection.</p>
<p class="contents">There will of course also be a separate debate when we vote tomorrow about something which, as I said at the beginning, I find quite absurd. I am referring to the fact that amendments concerning the analysis and control process are being ruled out because we are told that this is the second reading, and there were no such amendments at first reading. But it was impossible to table such amendments during the first reading, firstly because one did not take place and secondly because the technology did not exist anyway.</p>
<p class="contents">That brings me to my last point, the logo to be used. The logo envisaged at present is a joke! I have tried it out on various people; I have drawn it and written next to it: ’What do you think this is? Is it an organic vegetable, a children's toy, what do you think?’. I have to tell you that food irradiation was about the last thing anyone thought of! I regard it as the worst kind of deliberate deception of the public. It really does not help if ‚irradiated’ is written next to it in tiny letters, because who knows what that really means? We know perhaps, but what about the average citizen? And does the print have to be so small? I think that we really cannot approve the logo as envisaged at present, because it amounts to deliberate deception, and I have tabled an amendment about this.</p>
<p class="contents">As so often, this has been handled badly. It would be absurd not to approve something that is desperately needed. We also need to consider what we will do if the Council takes years to agree on a common position! In the meantime the world will have changed and changed again ten times, the political climate will have altered, new technologies will have emerged and we shall be stuck with two readings that no longer make any sense at all. I beg you to change our Rules of Procedure so that we can get on with protecting the consumer instead of putting this issue on the back burner because of legal niceties.</p>

<img align="absmiddle" alt="" src="/doceo/data/img/arrow_summary.gif"/>  <span class="doc_subtitle_level1_bis">Whitehead </span> <span class="bold">(PSE).</span> – Mr President, I want to congratulate Mrs Bloch von Blottnitz on her long involvement in this matter which far preceded my coming into this Parliament and may well go on long after I have left it.</p>
<p class="contents">Apparently the international radura label is sending Mrs Bloch von Blottnitz blind. There are many things that might send you blind, but I would not have thought this innocent label is one of them. It is one of the issues on which the Committee on the Environment, Public Health and Consumer Protection took a different view in its own debate from the point of view the rapporteur has put today.</p>
<p class="contents">Opinion is still divided on when and how irradiation can be used for the preservation of food. What has changed, of course, in these eight years – and this makes it impossible for us to go back to a renewed first reading – is the arrival of the Single Market. In many Member States now, which have set their face against irradiation, there is a probability that they will now have to admit irradiated foods whether they like it or not. Tesco, in my country, has shown that a not insignificant percentage of foodstuffs not declared as irradiated have been found to be so. So I think one of the first principles which is in the proposals that have come back to us in this long‐delayed common position which we have been presented with is that you should put consumer safety – and first, and foremost, information – at the head of our agenda.</p>
<p class="contents">The principles which should guide us today have been clear since that first reading debate. They are: only irradiate when public health gains and the consumer benefits; label with accuracy but not with hysteria; and strictly limit the products which are so treated with additions subject to codecision. Frogs' legs, which Mrs Bloch von Blottnitz mentioned, are now struck off from the list of products, and quite rightly so. We are now down to three products. We do not want to see further additions without a quite specific procedure subject to codecision once more before they are authorized.</p>
<p class="contents">This is what the Environment Committee's own amendments have attempted. The consensus that we have built there, supplemented tonight, I hope, by agreement on the radura label – I look forward to hearing what the spokesman of the EPP says on this because they have been very reluctant to have any proper warning labelling – is the best approach, rather than the skull and cross‐bones approach which we have had from the rapporteur. I do not know which of the amendments will be ruled in order because a number were struck out in the Environment Committee. So it is hard to argue a hypothesis. We do not know what you will accept at this stage.</p>
<p class="contents">We cannot support Amendments Nos 29, 31, 32 and 33 because the key cautionary words there – what the rapporteur wishes to say – have been absorbed into the other committee amendments or by alternative symbols or the careful wording we have put in our Amendment No 30.</p>
<p class="contents">In conclusion, what we want is a precautionary framework and not a prohibitive diatribe. I appeal to colleagues to support the amendments of the Environment Committee.</p>

 Mr President, ladies and gentlemen, I can understand the rapporteur's dissatisfaction at the rejection of these amendments which are only made necessary in the first place because of a new report from the Council. I urge the President to reconsider this, because we really need these amendments. They concern new issues that we need to vote on, in my opinion. So I too believe it is high time we made some headway on the directive on the irradiation of foodstuffs. A start was made many years back. The previous speakers have already mentioned that it took the Council eight years to reach a decision. Of course national regulations range from a complete ban on irradiation to its unrestricted use. That means there will naturally be problems in reaching a consensus, but eight years seems a bit too long to me.</p>
<p class="contents">At the heart of all this are the people who ultimately consume these foodstuffs, the consumers. I believe that they should be able to tell if a product has been irradiated or not. The labelling requirement takes account of this and is therefore an essential component of this directive. Mr Whitehead, we need to clearly follow the labelling directive here, as it shows us the way forward. Madam rapporteur, you yourself have seen the problems with new signs and symbols. They will not work. Let us stick to what the consumer knows and write it on the label. As far as I am concerned we could also stipulate the dimensions in centimetres or some other unit. But consumers are used to the label showing how a product has been treated. So I would like to make a plea that we should proceed along the lines of the labelling directive, which seems far better.</p>
<p class="contents">Another extremely important issue is the detectability of irradiation. Without it, how can we spot any inaccurate information on labels? If we are to allow foodstuffs to be irradiated, we must ensure that the interests of the consumer are protected and that proper monitoring is possible. These proposals would guarantee that.</p>
<p class="contents">Furthermore, we must stick to the principle that hygiene and health provisions, and satisfactory production and farming methods, in accordance with European standards should always be given priority over irradiating foodstuffs. We must veto any attempts to rely on irradiation instead because it might be cheaper.</p>
<p class="contents">We have our consumers' health in our hands here today. We take this responsibility seriously and call for compulsory labelling and for checks on irradiated products, in order to protect Europe's consumers.</p>
<p class="contents">We in this Parliament naturally want to take part in the important decision‐making process that lies ahead. Nothing inspires more confidence in consumers than open discussion in Parliament. We will certainly have enough to discuss when it comes to the list of approved foods.</p>

 Mr President, Madam Commissioner, ladies and gentlemen, this proposal regarding the ionization of food was presented for first reading in 1989. It raised so many problems, so many fears on the part of the general public, Parliament and the Council, that the latter did not adopt a common position until 27 October 1997, eight years later!</p>
<p class="contents">To clarify the debate, two quite distinct parts have been proposed: on the one hand, a framework directive regarding the general conditions for food ionization, and on the other, an implementing directive establishing the list of food products which may be ionized, a list which currently consists of only one category of product: herbs and spices. This has been agreed on, there are no complaints, but it still has to be implemented in stages until 31 December 2000, in consultation with the Scientific Committee for Food.</p>
<p class="contents">We can congratulate ourselves on the adoption of this directive, whose objective is firstly to safeguard health, but also to provide the consumer with sufficient information. Indeed, all the studies carried out up until now have unambiguously demonstrated that ionization of food products poses no risk whatsoever to the health and safety of the consumer. The ionization of food, of products susceptible to contamination, for example, must even be considered as beneficial to the consumer by providing safer, healthier food and by preserving the nutritional quality of the product better than other techniques. However, this method must not serve to cover up defective preparation of a food product, nor be employed when it is not necessary.</p>
<p class="contents">In conclusion, this directive brings every possible guarantee of clear information and control of the different stages of food ionization. It can be voted for without the amendments proposed by the rapporteur, which bring no improvement and which, on the contrary, risk causing detrimental confusion by using a symbol, which is misleadingly worrying, which would label food as “radura’ when an unambiguous label has already been provided for.</p>

 Mr President, I would first like to congratulate the rapporteur on her work on this report.</p>
<p class="contents">In the common position irradiation is accepted as a possible method of preserving foodstuffs. Even though at present there is only one category, which was mentioned earlier, namely herbs and spices, it is still the idea that it should be possible to use it for considerably more foodstuffs. I believe <span class="italic">that</span>
 is what people must take into consideration when they decide on this issue.</p>
<p class="contents">The Committee on the Environment, Public Health and Consumer Protection has put its finger on the health aspects. I think that is important and would appeal to the Members of this House to support the amendments from the Committee on the Environment. Then there will be an opportunity to further strengthen the opinions in the common position.</p>
<p class="contents">We know that in today's EU it is the case that certain countries allow the irradiation of foodstuffs, while other countries do not allow it, such as Sweden and Germany. Personally I am of the opinion that radiation does not belong together with food and foodstuffs. It should therefore not be allowed to happen. In itself, what has been said here may be true, that it does not present any risk to human health. There are also tough requirements so that it is not <span class="italic">allowed</span>
 to present any risk. However, there is another aspect, namely the false impression of freshness which irradiated foodstuffs can give. Food can look as if it is quite fresh, even though underneath it is old and quite bad. That is a way to mislead consumers. In this respect, it does not help no matter how many labels are put on food because the appearance itself misleads consumers.</p>
<p class="contents">For my part, I am going to support the rapporteur's amendments in this House, even though my group is limiting itself mainly to supporting the amendments proposed by the Committee on the Environment. I see it as two steps: first and foremost that we support the Committee on the Environment; but the same time it would make sense to go a step further and support the amendments which have been presented to the parliamentary debate by the Green Group.</p>

 Mr President, the fact that several Member States have already been imposing a ban on the irradiation of foodstuffs for many years, and that this has worked very well, shows that irradiation is fundamentally unnecessary as a method of preserving food. There are also clear disadvantages with losses in nutritional value when you extend the shelf life of foodstuffs.</p>
<p class="contents">The best thing in this situation would be if we could decide on a ban on the irradiation of foodstuffs with the exception of herbs and spices, but we do not have that option here. The choice between the Council's position and the proposals of the Committee on the Environment is simple. The Committee on the Environment tightens the rules in this area on a number of points, not least with regard to labelling, the view on hygiene and health practices which cannot be substituted by irradiation, and methods of analysis. My group is therefore going to vote in favour, not only of the Committee on the Environment's amendments, but also most of the amendments proposed by the Green Group.</p>

 Mr President, in October 1989 I was amongst those who voted for my colleague, Mrs Block von Blottnitz"s report, who at the time was no longer here. She had been replaced by Mrs Quistoudt‐Rowohl but in fact it was she who had drawn up the report. This report, which was voted for by a very large majority, proposed the banning of the principle of food irradiation, with the exception of herbs and spices. The position of the Council, which is a double one, and which has taken eight years to reach us, is based on the opposite logic. Now it is setting up this method as a method of food conservation with, firstly, the possibility of irradiating herbs and spices.</p>
<p class="contents">Given the enormous amount of time that has lapsed, I therefore find it logical to accept all the amendments which move in the direction of re‐establishing the position at the time of the first reading. I note that some of the amendments will not be put to the vote, unless the Presidency changes its mind before tomorrow, in particular Amendment No 27, but also two amendments which were approved by the Committee on the Environment, numbers 10 and 13. Nevertheless, there is a problem with this. The Chairman of the Committee on the Environment rejected certain amendments but accepted others and the Presidency of the Parliament has taken another position. You must admit that this makes things a bit messy. In such conditions, wisdom would suggest that all of the amendments are accepted and submitted to the vote, in the knowledge that some will not be voted for.</p>
<p class="contents">I would though like to ask for two types of amendment: those which recommend a logo. I have furthermore cosigned, with Mrs Bloch von Blottnitz, an amendment requesting that there should be a very clear logo. Indeed, the labelling as it is anticipated is insufficient, we all know that, and does not enable the consumer to be seriously informed. In addition, I believe that it is necessary to have a systematic method of analysis. How can we accept that irradiated products may be put on the market when a standardized and effective method of analysis does not exist? It is unacceptable. You cannot have a ruling which has no method of verifying whether it has been respected or not. It is incoherent. I therefore propose that we vote for these amendments through a concern for coherence, in particular, Amendment No 27.</p>

 Mr President, common consumption rules in the EU are good in principle, as there is a considerable volume of goods in circulation. When goods cross frontiers, we risk having to accept irradiated products in practice, unless this field is regulated. Irradiating food must not become the solution to long distance haulage and poor storage. An irradiated apple may look fresh, but actually be old. Shops can continue to sell food past its sell‐by date if irradiation is allowed. The Council proposes that very few foods may be irradiated – only spices. I am satisfied with that. But, unfortunately, gradually extending the allowed list could alter this situation. The requirements are stringent, that must be admitted, but it is essential that things happen out in the open, with Parliament's involvement and in accordance with important health and consumer principles.</p>
<p class="contents">One of the main principles of the EU's consumer legislation is that consumers must not be misled. They would be if we allowed irradiation, because food would appear to be different from how it actually is. The need for irradiation as a way of preserving food is also hard to see. Europe has mountains of food. If food can be irradiated, it must be marked in any case. Consumers must be able to choose, even in the cases which pass the health test; I support the studies of the health risks from irradiation. Nor does irradiation deal with all the toxins in food. On the contrary, some of them thrive on it. It is also important to say what methods of irradiation may be used. This is an aspect the Council has overlooked, but which the European Parliament"s Committee on the Environment will be taking up.</p>

 Mr President, I can agree wholeheartedly with my party colleague, Mrs Bloch von Blottnitz. The irradiation of foodstuffs is risky and unnecessary, at least for all foodstuffs with the possible exception of certain herbs and spices.</p>
<p class="contents">That is also the official view of the Swedish government. Under current Swedish rules, irradiation is banned except for certain herbs and spices. That makes this a very special case for Sweden. One of the most important promises given before Sweden's membership of the EU was that no rules for the protection of health and the environment would have to be weakened. I repeat: <span class="italic">no</span>
 such rules would have to be weakened.</p>
<p class="contents">If Parliament does not follow Mrs Bloch von Blottnitz" amendments, Sweden will be forced to weaken its legislation. That would further intensify the crisis which exists, for many reasons, between Sweden and the EU. If that happens, it would be the most serious weakening of Swedish health rules, so I really hope that Parliament supports Mrs Bloch von Blottnitz' amendments.</p>

 Mr President, I find myself having to take part in this second reading debate and vote, despite the fact that the first reading took place before my country joined the European Union, so that neither I nor anyone else from my country had an opportunity then to bring forward ideas or modifications that could be reintroduced as amendments now. I really think that in view of all the changes in the European Community and given its enlargement, we need to rethink the rules for first and second readings and conciliation, so that all Member States are on the same footing.</p>
<p class="contents">As for the subject matter itself, my view is that we should avoid irradiating foodstuffs, because I am afraid that it will be used to give an appearance of freshness and as a substitute for other hygiene measures, thus misleading consumers. Nevertheless, I believe that we need to proceed with this second reading and that the vote in the part‐session should mirror the vote in the Committee on the Environment, Public Health and Consumer Protection, because information, labelling and above all checks on irradiated products need to be prescribed in the interests of consumers throughout the internal market. That is the only way to guarantee that consumers have a free choice of foodstuffs.</p>
<p class="contents">I also think it is particularly important that we should be able to follow the deliberations of the Standing Committee on Foodstuffs in public, that we should have a say, and I do not mean just having an influence on which foodstuffs are added to the herbs and spices already on the list. We also need to have information on the duration and strength of the irradiation of individual foodstuffs, which is also important. Only openness and labelling will convince consumers that the European Parliament and the European Union are concerned about preventive health protection and are working on it.</p>

<img align="absmiddle" alt="" src="/doceo/data/img/arrow_summary.gif"/>  <span class="doc_subtitle_level1_bis">Bjerregaard, </span> <span class="italic">Member of the Commission. – (DA)</span>
 Mr President, the Commission's 1989 proposals were aimed at establishing a system of close checks on irradiated food, right through from producers' use of the process to sales of products to end‐users. To make it easier to get legislation passed on this subject, the Council divided the proposals into two parts, namely a framework directive and an implementation directive, with a list of the foodstuffs which could be irradiated. The eight category of foods in the Commission's proposals as amended were reduced to one in the common position, namely dried, aromatic spices, including roots. On the proposal"s position on whether it is necessary to use standardised methods of inspection to detect if food has been irradiated, I must point out that controls on many other preservation processes involve administrative and not laboratory checks. As you will know, the standardisation work is being carried out by an independent body, the CEN.</p>
<p class="contents">Like other foods, irradiated food is covered by the control directives, namely Directives 89/397 and 93/99. This means that Amendments Nos 9, the second part of 11, 13, 27 and 32 to the framework directive cannot be accepted, nor can the corresponding amendments to the implementation directive, namely Nos 2, 3 and the second part of 1. As far as the selection procedure is concerned, it should be remembered that any amendments of a political nature must be approved at this meeting. So any criticism of the draft to the effect that the regulatory committee has too much influence on this directive is unjustified. The Standing Committee can only take political decisions in cases where a Member State has implemented protective measures. So the Commission must stand by the Council's wording and reject Amendments Nos 8 and 19.</p>
<p class="contents">To deal with technical questions, the recommendation states that the Standing Committee should have advisory status, as the Commission originally proposed. To ensure that the directive is not blocked, although according to the White Paper, it should already have been adopted, the Commission has been forced to accept a regulatory committee. It is therefore impossible to accept Amendments Nos 14, 16 and 17, which deal with the appointment procedure, or Amendment No 15 on the internal rules of the committee, which it passes itself.</p>
<p class="contents">As far as the obligation to consult the Scientific Committee on Food in Article 13 is concerned, this should not be confused with the joint decision‐making procedure which the directive lays down for passing further provisions affecting public health. Amendments Nos 6 and 18 are therefore unnecessary and are rejected.</p>
<p class="contents">As marking is now obligatory in all cases, consumers will always be able to make an informed choice between products which contain and do not contain irradiated ingredients. Amendments Nos 5, 26 and 29, introducing a symbol to indicate food which has been treated, are therefore superfluous and cannot be accepted.</p>
<p class="contents">Many of the amendments are designed to supplement and clarify the text. I am referring here to Amendments Nos 1, 2, the first part of 3, 4, 7 and 12 to the framework directive and the first part of Amendment No 1 to the implementing directive. Amendments Nos 30, 31 and 33 cannot be accepted, as there cannot be any doubt that the procedure is safe. Amendment No 10 links the conditions for permitting irradiation of food to the obligation on Member States to provide the Commission with information. There is no close connection between the two subjects, and so the proposal cannot be accepted. The first part of Amendment No 11 is unacceptable as the question is covered by section 1 of Article 1.</p>
<p class="contents">Amendment No 24 reduces the time available for withdrawing irradiated products which do not meet the terms of the directive from 24 to 12 months. Such a short period would make implementing the directive very difficult, and the amendment proposed must therefore be rejected. Amendments Nos 21, 22 and 28 restrict the opportunities for using and exploiting the irradiation of food. It is difficult to justify why consumers, who must finally decide what is beneficial or necessary to them, should not be able to take decisions for themselves, but have certain conditions imposed on them instead. This amendment cannot therefore be accepted.</p>

<p class="contents">I have heard the statements of several Members in connection with the amendments declared inadmissible by the President.</p>
<p class="contents">As I imagine that the matter will be raised tomorrow as well, I would like to remind you of its content.</p>
<p class="contents">Article 125 states that, “the President shall decide’: Mr Lannoye, not the Presidency, but the President, in other words, not the President at the time but the President of Parliament. The end of Article 125 states, “The President"s decision...concerning the admissibility of amendments is not based exclusively on the provisions of paragraphs 1 and 2 of this Rule but on the provisions of the Rules in general’.</p>
<p class="contents">Article 72 states that, “The President"s discretion to declare an amendment admissible or inadmissible cannot be questioned’, on which account the doors seem to be closed.</p>
<p class="contents">However, I would also like to read, just for information and out of curiosity, paragraph 2 of Article 70, which states that, “In the light of the conclusions of the Conciliation Committee, Parliament"s delegation may recommend that consideration of the common position and any amendments tabled to it be resumed or, in consultation with the committee responsible, propose new amendments for consideration by Parliament in accordance with Rule 72’.</p>
<p class="contents">Naturally, behind this paragraph of the Rules of Procedure lies an entirely politico‐institutional question relating to the conciliation procedure and the merits of the results of conciliation, but I still seem to sense a slight possibility there, at least in the Rules of Procedure, for later on.</p>
<p class="contents">I have also read these articles because I think I will have to chair the conciliation, Mrs Bloch von Blottnitz, on which account we will have to discuss this problem again.</p>

 Mr President, I am pleased that we shall be sitting on the Conciliation Committee together; that makes me more optimistic. However, I think that what the Commission has just told me is absolutely scandalous. You are telling us you are accepting no amendments whatsoever! You are saying that it is simply not possible. To me, it is absolutely incomprehensible, scandalous and brazen that you can say straight to our faces that according to Article 100a we have no further role in the process. That is exactly the point of Amendment No 19, to make sure that Parliament still has a say under Article 100a when the positive list is received. You have just denied that here, Commissioner! That means that we will be mere spectators for the rest of the proceedings, that when it comes to the election campaign out there we will have to face the music for things fixed by wheeling and dealing in smoke‐filled rooms. I am telling you straight: I refuse to play ball! It is simply not on. It is outrageous!</p>
<p class="contents">We are supposed to have a share in decision‐making. This Parliament is supposed to have its rights, but these rights are constantly being insidiously undermined. This whole business of irradiating foodstuffs is only any good for whiskey drinkers in the end, because it makes whiskey age quicker! Are we supposed to defend all this? Up to now, I have gone along with this, because I have said there may well be good reasons for irradiation. But now I have heard what the Commission has to say, I will not accept it. I will not accept it. I will not accept it. I have had enough! Maybe you will put me right, maybe I have just got the wrong end of the stick. Yet again we are being treated just like stupid children who have to clear up the mess when we do not even have a say in things. I will not stand for it! It makes a mockery of democracy, shared decision‐making and the internal market. Why should we get the stick for your actions? It is not on! Or perhaps I have misunderstood.</p>
<p class="contents">You, Mr President, have given us some very good tips, but before tomorrow's vote, I shall take the liberty of invoking Rule 62, second indent. I shall not quote it now, because it is already so late, but I shall refer to it tomorrow. It states that amendments can indeed be tabled on matters not previously dealt with at first reading. We can and will do that. I know that it is not your decision; you cannot help it. You just have the misfortune to be in the chair now. Many thanks for your patience, and goodbye!</p>

 Mr President, I would like to comment on the point about whiskey; I find that interesting. I have discovered this evening that whiskey can be artificially aged by irradiating it. It is not your fault, but I would nevertheless like you to convey the mood of this House to the President, who is responsible for this matter. I am referring to Rule 72, not to the sentence that you referred to, but to Rule 72, 2c. It states that amendments are only admissible if they seek to amend a part of a text which was not included in the proposal submitted in first reading, etcetera.</p>
<p class="contents">I have checked with various colleagues on a cross‐party basis, and they agree that the text does contain new points, because there have been developments in this field in recent years. What we have before us today did not exist then, probably not even in people's wildest dreams. So it is not only logical or possible, but urgently <span class="italic">necessary</span>
 to allow these amendments to be tabled. Everyone agrees on this, there is no dissent. Please convey this to the President.</p>
<p class="contents">Secondly, I would like you to clarify what happens in a situation when the chairman of the Committee on the Environment decides, by virtue of his office and personal views, not to accept amendments, and the President then refuses to admit quite different amendments by virtue of his own prerogatives. There is a mismatch, a lack of consistency. What happens then? There is obviously a real muddle between these two gentlemen. I would be grateful if you could clarify this. What is the right thing to do now? Do we have to have a total rethink?</p>
<p class="contents">Thirdly, I would like to refer to Rule 125, according to which the President has the last word and his decisions cannot be contested. I ask you seriously, is there a limit to what cannot be contested? For example, is there a limit such as logic, intelligence or doing the obvious? Are there any such limits, or are we in that Grimm's fairy tale, the Emperor's New Clothes? The one where everyone says, wow, he looks great, the President has got brilliant clothes, until someone comes along – a little child – and says that the President is in the altogether!</p>
<p class="contents">Are there no limits to the inviolability of the President's decisions? I am asking you, because I know that you are very democratic, Mr President!</p>

I think you are showing substantial tolerance – at least in listening, though not in your rulings. What I want to say to the Commission representative and to you, as our representative here, is that if this proposal does not go to conciliation in which the view of Parliament is heard, including the views of those Member States who were not members of the Union when this proposal first came forward, then we make a mockery of our right to be consulted and to be absorbed into this discussion. We have consistently counselled against amendments that simply allow Parliament to meddle. For Parliament not to be consulted or not to have any appropriate say at the next stage of proceedings would be a total absurdity and I hope that this will be taken into account when you consider the rulings you are giving tomorrow and when the Commission reflects on what it said in removing almost all of these amendments from the book.</p>

We all know what it means when the Commission does not agree to any amendment: the entire conciliation stage becomes more complicated for Parliament.</p>
<p class="contents">With regard to the Rules of Procedure in the strict sense, I would like to tell Mr Roth that President Gil‐Robles is as democratic as I am, and that he will obviously be informed of the debate this evening. It seems I should tell you that the issue raised by Mr Graenitz and Mr Whitehead should not be emphasized repeatedly because it is of no significance, other than of a general nature, and certainly not with regard to the Rules of Procedure. New Member States have joined since then and this has not had any effect from the point of view of the debate we are holding on the Rules of Procedure: the Rules of Procedure do not change with each new accession.</p>
<p class="contents">You should remember, not for now but for the future, that a discussion is underway for the post‐Amsterdam period. The Committee on the Rules of Procedure is already discussing its amendments to the Rules of Procedure after and as a result of the Treaty of Amsterdam. Mrs Bloch von Blottnitz has already pointed out that reference will be made to Article 62, and there do not seem to be many margins; however, it is obviously within her rights to raise this problem with the President tomorrow, when it is put to the vote. I repeat, however, that the President will be informed of this debate to make the appropriate decisions, for which there are no limits, other than those of the Rules of Procedure, Mr Roth!</p>

<img align="absmiddle" alt="" src="/doceo/data/img/arrow_summary.gif"/>  <span class="doc_subtitle_level1_bis">Jackson </span> <span class="bold">(PPE), </span><span class="italic">rapporteur</span>. – Mr President, the European Union's waste policy is at an earlier stage in its development than European policy on air and water quality. We see the characteristics of what is still rather an experimental policy in the landfill directive. I must ask some rather fundamental questions about this directive in the hope of getting some answers from the Commission.</p>
<p class="contents">Firstly, it is important to recognize that this directive, if it is fully implemented – and that is a big ‚if’ – would result in a switch of emphasis away from landfill as a means of waste disposal. This is because it incorporates the progressive introduction of limits on the volume of biodegradable waste going to landfill set out in Article 5. This is a new section of the directive, new since its rejection by us in 1996. In many countries the limits will mean a switch to incineration. My fundamental question here is whether a directive which would impel such a universal switch in emphasis fully respects the principle of subsidiarity. I do not believe that it does.</p>
<p class="contents">The targets set out in Article 5 are very precise even if they are national ones and not designed to apply to specific sites. One consequence of ignoring subsidiarity is that a universal solution is proposed for very different situations in the Member States. Some countries now have sophisticated landfill systems and geological structures which make landfill a sustainable option and perhaps the best practicable environmental option. In others unregulated landfills in inappropriate places are a health hazard.</p>
<p class="contents">For all its protests about local option, the directive removes far too many key decisions to the European level from the national and the local. Secondly, it is important to recognize that the directive, if fully implemented, would mean that several Member States would need to spend very considerable amounts of money on finding alternative means of waste disposal and putting in place the systems of control that would enable them to prove they are abiding by the directive.</p>
<p class="contents">My fundamental question here is whether there is any hope at all that the Member States will be able to comply with the directive, as drafted, within the time limits set? The clear answer is no. 99 % of Ireland's waste goes to landfill. There is no prospect of any rapid switch to an alternative there. 54 % of Portugal's waste goes to an ‚unknown destination’. In Greece the Commission tells us that there are from 3, 000 to 6, 500 illegal landfills. None of these countries will be able to comply with the directive as drafted. If it is agreed as drafted, they will be pursued through the Court of Justice for years by the Commission.</p>
<p class="contents">In my own country, the United Kingdom, the Department of the Environment, Mr Prescott's department, has estimated that as many as 70 waste incinerators would have to be built at a possible cost of as much as £7 billion. Where will Mr Blair find that? As rapporteur, I have to report that my committee has supported the directive and in one respect has strengthened its detailed provisions by making the 2002 limits mandatory rather than optional. If that were all, I might have had a problem in continuing to represent my committee's point of view but the committee did something else. For the first time the Committee on the Environment, Public Health and Consumer Protection has at every stage passed amendments to tie the Member States down to the commitment they will make by agreeing such a directive.</p>
<p class="contents">We want them to put their money where their mouths are. In our amendments we want to use the directive first to make the Member States apply the existing law by shutting down illegal landfills which do not comply with existing directives. We want to use the directive to ensure that the Member States report frequently on implementation of the law, in particular during the progressive application of targets to reduce the amount of biodegradable waste going to landfill.</p>
<p class="contents">We also want to make sure that we do not forget the exempted sites where the directive will not apply. Information on them too should be sent to the Commission and hence made available to Parliament.</p>
<p class="contents">Finally, we should not forget that the Member States voted unanimously for the former version of this directive which effectively excluded 50 % of EU territory from its scope. If it was acceptable to them then, how can we realistically hope that they will fully implement this much more stringent directive. I do not believe that Parliament should connive at the passing of laws which are little more than the self‐indulgent aspirations of environment ministers.</p>
<p class="contents">I hope Parliament keeps a very tight check on what happens to this directive and I look forward to doing so. I also hope that at some stage Mrs Bjerregaard might actually involve herself in a debate on this directive, perhaps with us here tonight. There is very little point in coming all the way to Strasbourg to act as a sort of sophisticated speak‐your‐weight machine, which is all we are getting from Mrs Bjerregaard when she simply reads out lists of amendments which are acceptable and not acceptable to the Commission. This is a parliament and a parliament expects debate.</p>

<img align="absmiddle" alt="" src="/doceo/data/img/arrow_summary.gif"/>  <span class="doc_subtitle_level1_bis">Bowe </span> <span class="bold">(PSE).</span> – Mr President, we all know the significance of this proposal to the many industrial sectors within the economies of the states of the Union which is perhaps one of the reasons why we have taken so long already to reach an agreement about the provisions of the proposal and why we find ourselves at this point in the legislative process. I do think, however, that we are near the beginning of the end rather than the end of the beginning.</p>
<p class="contents">The new Commission proposal meets many of the concerns expressed by Parliament the last time it was presented to Parliament. It has risen like a phoenix from the ashes and Parliament must congratulate the Commission, in part, on the proposal. At the same time, I would extend my congratulations to the rapporteur, Mrs Jackson, for the work that she has done on it.</p>
<p class="contents">In response to some of the points that she has made I would say, first of all, that European‐wide standards that can be enforced are absolutely necessary to regulate what is, in truth, a European‐wide business in many cases. Incineration is not inevitable. There are many other technologies available and, in particular, steps in the development of large‐scale composting as an alternative to dealing with organic waste in the last few years have meant that this is a real and genuine alternative if energy and effort – and other resources – are put into bringing this into regular practice across the Union.</p>
<p class="contents">I have to correct her by telling her that the last time this proposal was dealt with by the Council of Ministers it did not vote it by unanimity, which was why when we rejected it in Parliament they could not reinstate it. They agreed it by a majority. This time, when you look at the political agreement they have arrived at – which looks astonishingly like a common position already – we will possibly find it harder to change it.</p>
<p class="contents">Nevertheless, I and the Socialists think that we need a set of practicable, sensible, enforceable Community‐wide standards which will deliver us a landfill industry which gets rid of many of the evils of the past. We should also recognize that this is not just an important economic directive, but also one that is important for the protection of the environment and public health. In particular, the harmful impact of bad landfill practices on groundwater resources and on global warming by the emission of methane from landfills is, in itself, a very good and strong reason why we need to take the actions that we are proposing in this proposal.</p>
<p class="contents">I would urge Parliament to support the Environment Committee's amendments that we will see in front of us tomorrow. It is a step forward in what has already been a very long process, but it is a step forward towards what I hope to see will be a completed proposal before the end of this year.</p>

 Mr President, waste disposal must be based on a certain hierarchy, <span class="italic">the Ladder of Lansink, as we call it in the Netherlands, </span>
 as Mr Lansink, a member of parliament came up with the idea that this hierarchy must be actively applied. This hierarchy comprises above all prevention, then re‐use and subsequently treatment, and in this treatment phase landfill is the last option.</p>
<p class="contents">To achieve this and cut back the amount of biodegradable waste going into landfills, Mr Jackson"s report contains important targets. The Committee on the Environment, Public Health and Consumer Protection has expressed its confidence in the original standards set by the European Commission. This is the only way we can arrive at uniform European measures.</p>
<p class="contents">Some Member States will have some catching up to do if they want to meet these targets. This is the only way we can offer the high environmental protection the European Union professes to aspire to. Economic incentives are also a part of this. All this does not mean, of course, that there may not be any exceptions. Non‐harmful dredged material is a good example of this. Certain countries, including my own, the Netherlands, have very effective environmentally friendly treatments which make an exception possible.</p>
<p class="contents">To conclude, Mr President, we support the report. Environmental policy occupies centre stage in European legislation. This directive on the landfill of waste should most certainly form part of this.</p>

 Mr President, this proposal on the landfill of waste has taken a long time, but hopefully the end is in sight now. Still, I think it has been worth the wait, because what the Commission has put on the table is a considerable improvement compared to the rejected common position of 1995.</p>
<p class="contents">In all sorts of ways, new developments have been taken into account. Separating biodegradable waste has been given a place, and the territory to which the directive applies comprises virtually the entire Union. These are big improvements. Likewise, the introduction of the cost aspect and after‐care of landfill sites are positive points.</p>
<p class="contents">And now the reality. How will it all work? The packaging directive contains incentives to stay as highly as possible within the waste hierarchy, but real life is often more unmanageable than the theory. In other words, it will depend on the efforts of the national and local authorities whether prevention and re‐use will be given genuine priority.</p>
<p class="contents">What concerns us particularly is the transport of waste to the cheap incinerators, and to the cheap landfill sites. The introduction of new costings for landfills must get under way very soon in the Member States. Although this directive looks a lot more pleasant than the earlier versions, we have to acknowledge the fact that billions of tonnes of waste are still dumped illegally, or are burnt with too many dirty emissions.</p>
<p class="contents">Implementation is therefore urgent, but there is still a big hiatus in the waste treatment chain. In the very short term there must be a review of the directive for the incinerators with new standards for emissions. My question to the Commissioner is: when will the proposal for this be ready? There is far too great an incongruity between incinerators.</p>

 It is pleasing to see the Council of Ministers taking note of the European Parliament's amendments in its otherwise slightly doubtful political agreement. The Commission's original proposals exempted about half of Europe from the directive's aims, which was rather absurd. Dumps are well down in the waste hierarchy, and there are specific rules dealing with restricting dumping, restricting waste tourism and ensuring environmentally sound dumping if that is the only option available. The Committee on the Environment proposes that groundwater is the main factor to consider when finding new dumping sites. As groundwater resources are the drinking water supplies in some countries, it is essential that they be protected as far as possible. In Denmark, about 90 % of drinking water comes from groundwater.</p>
<p class="contents">It is pleasing to note that the proposals include demands for processing biodegradable waste. This can produce gas at landfill sites, and in fact this kind of waste should be sorted and some of it composted. It is also pleasing to note that the proposals are now on their way through the decision‐making process, as waste is one of the areas where legislative protection is still incomplete.</p>

<img align="absmiddle" alt="" src="/doceo/data/img/arrow_summary.gif"/>  <span class="doc_subtitle_level1_bis">Watson </span> <span class="bold">(ELDR).</span> – Mr President, the Liberal group favours reducing the amount of waste and making the treatment of waste safer. There are two approaches to waste disposal: incineration where geographical conditions and population density mean that landfill is inappropriate; and landfill itself. Both have their problems. Incineration can cause air pollution, landfill can cause groundwater pollution and the production of methane, a greenhouse gas.</p>
<p class="contents">But technology is minimizing those problems. In my view this directive is biased in favour of incineration but it allows both approaches to continue. The Committee on the Environment, Public Health and Consumer Protection has made it rather more one‐sided and some of its amendments would effectively change policy to incineration only. My group favours a gradual move towards incineration, particularly of waste which is not biodegradable. But we do not wish to overlook the new, green growth industry which involves methane collection and the production of energy from waste. The Commission document published recently on methane gas recognizes the importance of this.</p>
<p class="contents">The Liberal group will vote against certain amendments put forward by the Committee on the Environment: those which would effectively outlaw landfill; those which we regard as over‐prescriptive; and those which we regard as impractical. Nonetheless, we support the aims of this directive and the work the Commissioner has done on it. We regret the position taken and the somewhat uncharitable remarks made by the rapporteur in this debate tonight. We believe this directive constitutes a move forward for the Union in terms of disposing of waste more effectively and taking greater care of the environment.</p>

 Mr President, this directive is a fine example of how the European Parliament"s influence on environmental legislation is increasing; our rejection of the original proposal led the Commission to amend it, for the better, and prompted the Council of Ministers itself to adopt a new approach and strategy.</p>
<p class="contents">The need for such a strategy was particularly pressing given that, as mentioned previously, in Member States such as Portugal, 54 % of waste until very recently went to unmonitored tips, approximately 10 % to controlled tips, and only 36 % to landfills. Meanwhile, however, a new government has taken office, a new majority has assumed legislative power and executive power, and a new strategic orientation has been adopted, as the Commission is aware. This includes the submission of a national waste administration plan, which is currently being implemented and under which some regions of the country, particularly the Algarve – Portugal"s leading tourist region – will be depositing all their waste in landfills by next summer.</p>
<p class="contents">In connection with the proposal currently under discussion, I would like to draw attention to the objectives of reducing methane gas emissions, prohibiting the combined disposal of dangerous and non‐dangerous waste and the pre‐treatment obligation which I consider to be very positive aspects which deserve to be highlighted.</p>
<p class="contents">I would also like to emphasize the discrepancy between the position of the European Parliament which advocates a reduction of 25 % by the year 2002, and the Council"s position which refers to the year 2006.</p>
<p class="contents">Finally, I would like to draw attention to the temporary exemptions granted to the islands; for example, in the Portuguese case, the islands of the Azores and Madeira which are exempted from the pre‐treatment of waste in the main landfill on each island up to a ceiling of 15, 000 tonnes. But I would like to stress the temporary nature of these regimes because, since the islands constitute an immense natural heritage of great value for tourism and the environment, they have everything to gain from implementing environmental policies that are not based on dispensations.</p>
<p class="contents">The main landfill in the autonomous region of the Azores" application to the Cohesion Fund constitutes a policy that could well serve as an example to be followed.</p>

<img align="absmiddle" alt="" src="/doceo/data/img/arrow_summary.gif"/>  <span class="doc_subtitle_level1_bis">White </span> <span class="bold">(PSE).</span> – Mr President, I thought I would congratulate everyone tonight as well. Let me start by congratulating the smiling Mr Bowe, whose courage in the last Parliament in rejecting the former landfill directive had to be experienced to be believed. He did a very good job on that occasion in saying that we would not accept a defective directive. He was right to do that.</p>
<p class="contents">I also congratulate the Commission as well. They have come forward with something which is necessarily stronger than it was the last time round.</p>
<p class="contents">I congratulate Mrs Jackson. I do not know whether she wants to be congratulated by me. From the tone of the contribution she made at the beginning, I thought that there was some reluctance on her part in the presentation of the report. However, it is right that she should be congratulated because she has accepted wholly now the principle of abolition of co‐disposal. That is something which is an argument made and accepted both in the Committee on the Environment, Public Health and Consumer Protection and by Parliament as a whole. However, it will mean in the United Kingdom a massive change in landfill practice. One of the reasons why it is important to stress that is that the European Parliament, when this is finally seen through to a directive, will have been responsible for a change in domestic practice in the United Kingdom about which so few people yet know.</p>
<p class="contents">Therefore it is important when Mrs Jackson, in the explanatory statement, asks for a cost estimate for us in Parliament to provide that to those landfill operators and local authorities in the United Kingdom who are going to have to look at this as a progressive proposal.</p>
<p class="contents">Mrs Jackson tells us rightly that in committee we are always met with the response that it is a greater cost if we do nothing than if we do something. Despite the uncharitable remarks made, as Mr Watson said, about the Commissioner being a speaking weight machine, I ask the Commissioner to be more charitable herself and tell us how much money there is in the landfill bank and what the cost of this proposal will be.</p>

 Mr President, in general let me say that in its present shape the directive on waste disposal at landfill sites is satisfactory. There are, however, far too few proposals coming from the EU on how the targets can be achieved.</p>
<p class="contents">A separate waste tax or payment is a necessary device for consumers, whether small or massive producers of waste, to cut down on the amount of waste they create that has to be taken to landfill sites. The tax or payment should be such that clean, sorted waste will be cheapest, and unsorted waste to be taken to landfill sites will be the most expensive to produce. This will obviously mean that local authorities and other responsible bodies will organize proper methods of sorting waste.</p>
<p class="contents">The EU must go further and take examples from the more enlightened Member States. We must support the use of landside waste, for example, as a source of energy or soil improvement agent, but at the same time new technology must be developed to ensure that the process will not harm the environment or health. We must make sure that seepage from both old and new landfill sites is handled in such a way that it does not pose a threat to both groundwater and surface water.</p>
<p class="contents">I think it is very important that the proposals for amendments concerning the protection of water, approved in the Committee on the Environment, be carried in tomorrow"s vote.</p>

<img align="absmiddle" alt="" src="/doceo/data/img/arrow_summary.gif"/>  <span class="doc_subtitle_level1_bis">Bjerregaard, </span> <span class="italic">Member of the Commission. – (DA)</span> Mr President, it gives me great pleasure to see that the European Parliament has put waste disposal on the agenda for today. The Community should long since have passed a directive to ensure that waste is disposed of in an environmentally responsible way. As has been mentioned, this is the second time we are dealing with a proposal for a directive on waste disposal. The Commission put forward its first proposals in July 1991, and as we remember and have been reminded during the course of the debate, the European Parliament rejected that proposal in May 1996 on the grounds that the level of environmental protection was not high enough and that there were too many exemptions.</p>
<p class="contents">The proposals we have before us today have been completely amended. That was not a very easy task, but I think we can be satisfied with the results. The new proposals contain a lot of new elements reflecting the developments which have occurred since the Commission's last proposals. There have been major changes in the procedures, methods and strategies for waste processing in many Member States. In line with the Community's waste processing policy, some Member States now believe that dumping should be the last resort when it comes to disposing of waste.</p>
<p class="contents">The main new points in the Commission's proposals are as follows: reduction targets for disposing biodegradable municipal waste with a view to reducing the global greenhouse effect; pre‐treatment – that is, not incineration, but pre‐treatment of all waste prior to disposal; an increase in the costs of waste disposal – as proposed by Mrs Myller; a ban on dumping toxic and non‐toxic waste together, which was of course part of the previous proposals which Parliament criticized; and finally more stringent conditions on existing landfill sites.</p>
<p class="contents">I am convinced that the new proposals will make it easier for us to prevent and reduce the effects of waste disposal on the environment. And we need to take action in this field as soon as possible. The many complaints which the Commission receives concerning the disposal of waste emphasize that the Community needs to act.</p>
<p class="contents">I have of course looked with great interest at the draft report which the Committee on the Environment adopted. There are many important and useful amendments which will tighten up the Commission's proposals and make the procedures clearer. I am therefore pleased to be able to say that the Commission can accept 16 of the amendments. But I must also admit that I am concerned about some sections of the report, and I will need to take some time over them. I am pleased to see that the European Parliament is able to support our efforts to reduce the landfill of biodegradable waste. We have established long‐term reduction targets for Member States: these targets must remain unchanged, however, to ensure that Member States have the best possible conditions for planning and implementing alternative methods of dealing with this waste. The Commission cannot therefore accept Amendment No 16.</p>
<p class="contents">As far as Amendments Nos 12 and 31 are concerned, I would like to emphasize that the Commission does not believe it would be right to grant more exemptions than those already proposed. I am particularly concerned about exempting underground disposal. There are no environmentally responsible grounds for exempting this kind of disposal. All landfill sites – whether above or underground – should meet the directive's conditions and so be safe and controlled. I cannot agree with the current approach in Germany where 1.7 million tonnes of waste, including 350 000 tonnes of toxic waste, was stored in old mines in 1994. In Germany, this is defined as recycling, not as disposal, and so waste disposal legislation does not apply. This is not environmentally responsible practice.</p>
<p class="contents">I am not against storing waste underground in general, but I think we should be certain that the underground storage facilities in question are covered by the provisions of the proposals on landfill sites. And so I cannot accept that exempting regulations should be introduced for underground disposal. It was precisely because of all the exemptions that the European Parliament rejected the Council's previous common position, whereas Parliament now wishes to introduce more exemptions. In the case of Amendment No 13, Parliament is trying to introduce yet another exemption. I cannot at this stage accept that spreading limestone and gypsum should be exempted, but I can promise Parliament that the Commission will take a closer look at this amendment and consider the possibilities.</p>
<p class="contents">Today, the Community has serious problems with landfill sites which are not monitored: this is clear from the large numbers of complaints and applications which the Commission receives. This situation must change. Existing landfill sites must meet the new requirements of the Commission's proposals and so obtain new licences before they can continue to operate. The approval requirements of the old framework directive on waste are not in line with developments in this field and cannot ensure that waste is disposed of under safe, controlled conditions. So the Commission cannot accept Amendment No 25.</p>
<p class="contents">This brings us finally to Amendments Nos 27, 30, 33 and 36, where the Commission believes that the provisions of the annexes should be laid down by the technical committee referred to in Article 16 of the Commission's proposals. As regards Amendment No 7, the Commission cannot be obliged to forward Member States' reports, but wishes to be able to produce reports based on information from Member States and pass it on to the European Parliament. Some people may see this as being rather semantic, but we believe we can handle problems this way.</p>
<p class="contents">As regards Amendments Nos 2 and 3 on changes to the views that the Commission should present new proposals within a period of time to be specified, we already have plans to submit a proposal on incinerating non‐toxic waste and we intend to produce a composting proposal as part of the work schedule. I cannot however approve of the way in which this amendment formulates the Commission's obligations.</p>
<p class="contents">There are a whole host of other amendments which ought to be commented on, but it is now late in the evening so I will leave it at that, unless there are any specific amendments which other Members of Parliament present wish to comment on in particular. Ian White asked me if I could say anything about the overall costs, but I am not in a position to do so as yet. That of course depends on developments in the Member States which are now under way.</p>
<p class="contents">And may I say to Mrs Jackson that I think the remarks she made at the end of her speech were particularly unkind. Having been here in Parliament since 3.00 p.m. today, which I set aside solely for discussing with Members of Parliament, I fail to understand her comments at all.</p>

Amendment No 16 was one of those which Mrs Bjerregaard said she was not prepared to accept. In fact there are two elements to Amendment No 16: one is the question of the targets for 2002, and Parliament and the committee would like to remove the words ‚as far as possible’ so that the 2002 targets become mandatory and not, as it were, optional. The other parts of that amendment deal with reporting.</p>
<p class="contents">There are two distinct bits to that amendment, I wonder whether Mrs Bjerregaard could clarify which bits she is not prepared to accept. I think it is very sad if the Commission does not accept – even at this early stage – amendments regarding the reporting requirement where essentially, for once, I agree with her advisor, in other words that Parliament should reinforce reporting. I would beg the Commissioner to accept that but if she will not accept it, I hope that Parliament will stick to its guns and go into conciliation on those points. I would be grateful just for clarification on that.</p>

 Mr President, in fact I was actually making a distinction, because I referred to Amendment No 16 twice in my answer. As far as the reporting is concerned, I said that we were concerned about the way the question on reporting was worded. But I will be happy to see if we in the Community can find some other wording.</p>
<p class="contents">As far as the question of making it mandatory in the year 2000, we do not believe we are in a position to decide this at present. We feel this would force Member States into a policy – in that sense, this is in line with the arguments which Mrs Jackson used herself – and we are not therefore in favour of making it mandatory in the year 2000. As far as reporting is concerned, we are support the idea, as has been said.</p>

. – What was the Commission's opinion on Amendment No 23. This is vital because these are the sites which would not have to comply with the directive. It is very simple. Does the Commissioner agree with Amendment No 23 or not? I hope that she does. I am almost minded to take back my earlier remarks but I do not think I will.</p>
