(PSE).</span> – Mr President, I refer to pages 12 and 13 of the English version of the Minutes and matters that were raised subsequently. This refers to the concern expressed by Members about the impact in the Chamber of the new arrangements for tying the payment of Members' expenses to voting requirements. I am not challenging this whole question of whether this is a proper system or not. I do not think it is, but that is not my purpose.
</p>
<p class="contents">Mr Falconer raised a number of points of order, and I was very concerned that the President in the Chair yesterday seemed to give him some kind of blanket exemption from the rules I understood had been decided. Mr Falconer quite properly asked for the opportunity to state his intention before every vote in which he did not participate. The President declared that should not be the case. He gave him a blanket exemption, which would make nonsense of the whole system.
</p>
<p class="contents">All I ask is that all the Vice‐Presidents follow a consistent policy, observe the rules that have been laid down for Members and give Members an opportunity at every stage to raise the question of whether they vote or not. If this system is to work, it has to be seen to be working properly and with the agreement of all the Vice‐Presidents.

What I can confirm, and I saw it yesterday too when Mr Jean‐Pierre Cot was in the Chair, is that there is every intention to apply it in the best possible way.

<span class="italic">
(FR)</span> Mr President, the Conference of Presidents was in favour of this reform and the Bureau approved it with a small majority, as we know. Yesterday we witnessed the effects which this could have and we are all well aware that we need to review the voting conditions.
</p>
<p class="contents">I believe that the solution proposed by our colleague would not be very effective and would risk slowing things down; since only some group chairmen in particular – not all of them – wanted this reform and the Bureau approved it with a small majority, it is essential to review the situation.
</p>
<p class="contents">Pending the Bureau"s re‐consideration of the issue, I am tempted to propose that prior to votes, all Members who do not wish to participate in certain roll‐call votes should have us make a note of their name, thus avoiding undue delay in the voting procedure. Members could therefore let us know that they will not participate in all the votes, and would thus not be involved. This is merely a temporary measure, pending a satisfactory solution.
</p>
<p class="contents">Mr President, that is my proposal.
</p>

<span class="bold">
(ARE).</span> – Mr President, I have one or two very simple corrections to the Minutes. I refer to the first paragraph of page 12. I did not say that I did not intend to take part in the vote. I agreed with Mr Falconer's position but said that I might or might not take part in the vote.
</p>
<p class="contents">On page 22 it states that I did not vote. In fact I voted every time, except once when the machine did not work.
</p>
<p class="contents">On page 11, my name should be alongside Mr Macartney's as abstaining in the roll‐call vote. I called to the attention of the Chair the fact that my machine did not work. I got a nod and thought it was in order but, quite clearly, the nod did not mean that it was in order.
</p>
<p class="contents">Lastly, on page 17 – which is a little more complicated – I am wrongly described in the last paragraph as requesting ‚that the matter be referred to the Rules Committee’. What I said was that this change amounted to an amendment of the Rules and, therefore, would have to be referred to the Rules Committee. I also corrected what the Vice‐President said when he declared that we had a duty to vote. I said that we do not have a duty to vote, we have a duty to understand what the votes are about. We have the right not to vote or vote, as we wish. I would like the Minutes to be corrected in that way.

(PSE).</span> – Mr President, it is important that we try to clarify this. Everybody in this House, yesterday and this morning, has been desperately trying to shuffle off responsibility for what happened here yesterday. I am not ashamed to stand here and say that I have been one of the group leaders, and every one of them in this room with me should perhaps stand up so you can see who we all are. We have been driving the process of reform in this House. We are not ashamed to say so.
</p>
<p class="contents"><span class="italic">
<span class="italic">
(Applause)</span> </span></p>
<p class="contents">Let us be clear how this reform came about. The idea of linking attendance with roll‐call votes came out of the working group established under the chairmanship of Nicole Pery. That was where these proposals came from. Every group in this House was represented on that working group. The Conference of Presidents does not establish these proposals or the way in which they are carried out. We kept pursuing the need for reform and putting pressure on the President and his predecessor, Klaus Hänsch, who have both been supportive of the process of reform. That is our role and we stand here absolutely and take our political responsibility for insisting that reform is carried through.
</p>
<p class="contents">Yesterday, Mr Killilea stood up on behalf of the Quaestors and said: ’It is not us, the Quaestors, the Bureau is responsible’. The Bureau, I understand, is trying to say it is the Conference of Presidents. I accept my responsibility for the reform. We did not lay down the detail of these proposals.
</p>
<p class="contents"><span class="italic">

(ES)</span> Mr President, I want to make it clear to the House that establishing the method for control and transparency is not a matter for the Conference of Presidents. We were invited to a meeting in Luxembourg so that we could give our opinion, but we did not stay in the room because we were invited to leave when Parliament"s Bureau made the decision. And I have to say that in my group we do not agree with this system of control, which does not guarantee transparency or that Parliament will work well.
</p>
<p class="contents">We are happy to sign in each morning and afternoon – that is the reasonable method of control that can be used in this House. However, we do not wish to be demagogic. The Bureau should have another meeting to think about this, and should take some reasonable measure that can be supported by a wide majority of the House.

(NL)</span> Mr President, ladies and gentlemen, the working group mentioned by Mrs Green had spent a long time preparing this reform. When Parliament"s Bureau had to take a decision in Luxembourg, it asked for our assistance. The group leaders did indeed take part in the Bureau"s discussion. We worked for and promoted a reform in anticipation of a statute for Members of the European Parliament. It is clear that after what happened yesterday the concrete implementation of this measure ought to be discussed anew. But I also wish to say that I was in favour of a reform in anticipation of a statute, and that this does not alter the responsibility which I have taken on this issue in the past, and which I maintain. I also believe, and on behalf of our group, that after the events of yesterday, the system needs to be looked at again, adjusted and perfected, without detracting from the responsibility we all have to accept.

(NL)</span> Mr President, it is obvious that the technical system which became operational yesterday, does not function properly, and it is provoking debates which damage the dignity and standing of this House. It is therefore obvious that the concrete measures which were decided must be reviewed. I would like to remind you that the deputy chairman of my group, Mr Haarder, made a proposal to the Bureau which was simple, transparent, clear and not bureaucratic, namely one check per voting period, and not an average of a number of checks. I would like to ask the Bureau to have another look at this. But I would like to say to the colleagues: the implementation of the reform must be reviewed, but not the principle of the reform measure.
</p>
<p class="contents">This House does many things well. We are having an increasing legislative influence. Our delegation"s visit to Algeria was a success. The committees of inquiry this Parliament set up into BSE and cigarette fraud were a great success. But the media does not see us as an important, successful and authoritative Parliament. Why not? Because the media quite rightly continue to reproach Members of this House who are somewhat casual in their financial mores. We should have the courage to search our consciences. We should have the courage to review matters that damage this House. Yes, colleagues, that includes you!

</p>
<p class="contents">Mrs Hoff made a point when she said: ’Let us look at the Rules to see if we can prevent what happened yesterday’. Well, let us look at the Rules to ensure that any changes which affect Members are brought to the Members and that Members have a right to vote on those changes. That would prevent the nonsense that went on yesterday.
</p>
<p class="contents">I return to the business of today – the Minutes. Page 12 is wrong. As far as I am concerned, I asked to be called, as Mrs Ewing quite rightly said, on each roll‐call vote. I was not given that opportunity by the President.
</p>
<p class="contents">Page 22 states again that I did not vote. I remind the President that I did participate in certain votes, particularly human rights. I participated and am recorded as such. The Minutes are wrong in both areas. I ask that they be corrected.
</p>
<p class="contents">Lastly, if we are to have a rule that comes down on high from the Bureau, then it has to be carried through by the House. The Bureau's ruling was that, prior to each roll‐call vote, the Members would indicate whether they wished to participate or not. That is what I hope we will continue to do until such time as this House begins to grasp some sense of reality and reverts back to some normality.

I refer to the Minutes last night. If Members had attended the debate last night on the final report, which was my report on landfill, they would have heard the Commissioner say that she was reluctant to give in full her speech with all the opinions of the Commission on the amendments tabled by Members of this House because it was late and she was rather tired.
</p>
<p class="contents">That is not good enough. Mr President, I would like you, if you could, to communicate with the Commissioner this morning to say that before we vote at 12.00 noon, it is essential that the Commission makes known to me, as rapporteur, to the committee chairmen and to all Members of this House exactly what its view was on the amendments tabled by Parliament. It is not enough that the Commissioner should say that she was tired and therefore unable to speak to us.

I think in the case of this point it is a question of Members and colleagues being frightened. In my office in recent weeks, three colleagues have been attacked. I have spoken with a large number of Members who have also been attacked and I believe we must discuss this subject.

<span class="italic">
President‐in‐Office of the Council</span>. – Mr President, thank you for the opportunity to address Parliament on this important issue.
</p>
<p class="contents">The debate takes place at a crucial moment in the crisis with Iraq. European Union Member States are united in being deeply concerned at this crisis. The Presidency has ensured that Iraq has been covered frequently during European Union meetings. Most recently the Foreign Secretary briefed partners during an informal session held in Panama in the margins of the European Union real group meeting on the 12 February. On the same day the issue was discussed by European Union political directors at a meeting of the political committee. Iraq was also discussed at political committee meetings on the 13 January and 3 February and at expert working group level. The Presidency has also had contacts at a high level with many European Union partners. The Prime Minister and Foreign Secretary have both been in frequent touch with their European counterparts to discuss the issue. I have been in contact with my counterparts in other European Union states in recent days. We will continue to promote discussion of the issue and will keep partners informed of developments at the United Nations.
</p>
<p class="contents">European Union Member States are united in believing that Iraq must allow the United Nations Special Commission to continue its vital work as laid down in Security Council Resolution 687 which was the resolution that provided a ceasefire for the end of the Gulf War. Under the terms of that Resolution, which Iraq accepted, the UN inspectors who form UNSCOM are given a mandate to remove all of Iraq's weapons of mass destruction. UNSCOM and the associated inspections by the International Atomic Energy Agency have scored major successes in removing Iraqi weapons of mass destruction. They have halted Iraq's longrange missile programme which could have brought Europe within range of Saddam's arsenals. They have dismantled the nuclear programme which could have led to Iraq developing a nuclear bomb. Through a process of inspection and verified destruction, UNSCOM has demolished more weapons capability than was ever destroyed by allied forces during the Gulf War.
</p>
<p class="contents">However, there are other areas of Saddam's weapons of mass destruction on which further work is required: namely, chemical and biological weapons. Saddam's chemical weapons include the VX nerve agent. He has not accounted to UNSCOM for 600 tonnes of chemical precursors for that nerve agent. One drop of the agent is enough to kill. The victims die in agony by suffocation as their nervous system ignores the signals to breathe. Saddam's biological weapons include anthrax. Experts say that 100 kilograms of anthrax released from the top of a tall building could kill up to 3 million people. Saddam has also produced aflatoxin which causes liver cancer and clostridium which results in gas gangrene. All of these weapons represent a serious threat to international peace and security.
</p>
<p class="contents">Three years ago, Saddam Hussein's sons‐in‐law, Hussein and Saddam Kamil, defected to Jordan. They brought with them evidence of a coordinated and sustained programme of concealment by Saddam of his chemical and biological weapons. Since then, UNSCOM has been working to uncover key points in the supply chain of the weapons programmes. Saddam has been equally determined to obstruct their work. In the last 20 months UNSCOM has sought access to 63 sites where it believed concealment was taking place. It was obstructed and delayed from carrying out inspections at 38 sites and was flatly refused access to a further 14 sites. Despite Security Council Resolution 687, Iraq only permitted prompt access at 20 % of sites under suspicion. We must remember that the only reason the UNSCOM regime and the sanctions to enforce it remain in place seven years after the Gulf War is because Saddam will not dismantle weapons of mass destruction, nor will he allow UNSCOM to do the job it has been mandated to do by the United Nations Security Council.
</p>
<p class="contents">People naturally ask: why is this important? The answer I believe is clear. Saddam Hussein has used weapons of mass destruction before. He did so against his neighbour, Iran, during the Iraq‐Iran war in the 1980s. He did so against his own people. Ten years ago next month, he dropped chemical weapons on a town in North East Iraq. The 5 000 people in the town of Halabja, including many women, children and old men, were killed.
</p>
<p class="contents">European Union Member States are united in their hope that a diplomatic solution to the present crisis can be found. We surely support all initiatives aimed at achieving that end. This morning, now the United Nations Secretary General has been given the backing of the Security Council for his mission to Baghdad, we all wish him every success. But we know that until now, Saddam has not appeared to be looking for a diplomatic solution. He persists in his obstruction of UNSCOM. He persists in his obstruction of the wish of the international community. He demands that inspections of so‐called presidential sites must be one‐off not continuing as required under Security Council Resolution 687.
</p>
<p class="contents">European Union Member States believe that any diplomatic solution must allow UNSCOM full and unconditional access to all sites as mandated by United Nations Security Council resolutions. We believe that Saddam Hussein must comply with the relevant United Nations Security Council resolutions.
</p>
<p class="contents">The present dispute over presidential sites exposes the Iraqi propaganda that it is sanctions that are the cause of the hardship and the suffering of the Iraqi people. We reject that. There are no sanctions, nor have there ever been. against the import of food and medicine. These are items in short supply in Iraq because Saddam Hussein has consistently refused to spend money on his own people, preferring instead to spend it on his own comforts and on his weapons programmes.
</p>
<p class="contents">The European Union is united in its concern for the humanitarian suffering of the Iraqi people. European Union countries on the Security Council in New York have taken the lead in trying to alleviate the worst of this suffering. The oil‐for‐food programme under which Iraq is allowed to export limited quantities of oil in return for humanitarian goods was first offered to Iraq in the summer of 1991 as United Nations Security Council Resolution 706 indicates. It was not until five years later that Saddam Hussein was shamed into accepting UN Security Council Resolution 986 which set up the present oil‐for‐food programme.
</p>
<p class="contents">Those European Union Member States at present on the Security Council have taken the lead in taking the recent recommendations of the UN Secretary General to more than double the amount of oil that Iraq can sell under this programme and turning them into a Security Council resolution. I very much hope that this resolution will be adopted this week. It will bring further humanitarian benefits to the Iraqi people.
</p>
<p class="contents">However, let us not forget that it is the United Nations, not Saddam, that is responsible for this. This is not surprising. One does not need to look far for evidence of the brutality of Saddam Hussein's regime. I recommend that Members study the report of Max van der Stoel, the UN's special rapporteur on human rights in Iraq. During the last six years he has catalogued a terrifying list of human rights violations by Saddam Hussein and his clique. Mr van der Stoel's most recent report describes human rights in Iraq as ‚terrible’. He concludes: ’The system of military dictatorship effectively requires that human rights violations occur in order to retain the position and privileges of those in power. Murder is routine. The price of criticizing the regime is execution. Recently Saddam Hussein decided that his prisons were over‐crowded. His solution was to execute all those serving longer than fifteen years. Over a thousand people were murdered.’
</p>
<p class="contents">Let me reiterate that European Union Member States are united in their desire to see this present crisis resolved diplomatically. This is the message that Kofi Annan takes to Baghdad on behalf of all of us. Let us hope that Saddam responds and cooperates fully with the United Nations Special Commission.

Vice‐President of the Commission. – (ES)</span> Mr President, the Commission"s view on this conflict is that we all think the international community"s first priority at the moment is to be able to reach an agreement with the Iraqi Government within the next few days, in order to avoid military intervention which basically nobody wants.
</p>
<p class="contents">There is no doubt that the correct authority for resolving the dispute is the United Nations. Therefore, as the President‐in‐Office of the Council has just said, the Commission also fully supports the activities of the United Nations Security Council, and especially its Secretary General, in their efforts to ensure that the Iraqi authorities comply fully with the Security Council resolutions. We hope the Secretary General"s current negotiations can prevent the conflict, so that UNSCOM can resume unrestricted and effective inspections in accordance with those resolutions.

(PSE).</span> – Mr President, my group is very aware of the responsibility it bears in this debate today. Within this group we have Members of Parliament who represent nine socialist and social democrat‐led governments in this Union, and these parties are in government in three more of the 15. We do not pretend that it is easy to find a common position, given the range of views which are represented not just in those 12 governments but also amongst the people of the European Union whom we represent. But I want to pay tribute to my colleagues who have striven to find principles which are common to us all and which unite us in this, one of the most difficult life‐and‐death decisions this present Parliament has had to confront since 1994.
</p>
<p class="contents">Firstly, we must remember that we, in the European Parliament, do not dispose of armies, aeroplanes, bombs or aircraft carriers. Let us be entirely honest; we do not even have a common foreign and security policy worth its name. We have made our criticism about the lack of progress of the CFSP quite clear in recent years and, particularly, our dissatisfaction at the provisions of the Amsterdam Treaty in this respect. So I think we need to demonstrate a little humility when it comes to decision‐making in this field, and show some support for those of our colleagues, of all political persuasions, who will be confronted with the decisionmaking on this issue in national parliaments; those who will really have the awesome responsibility for the lives of their fellow citizens under arms and those of the many thousands of Iraqi citizens who are at risk. With all of this in mind, my group has just three main strategic political points which it wants to make in this debate.
</p>
<p class="contents">Firstly, we insist absolutely that Saddam Hussein must comply fully with the resolutions of the United Nations Security Council and allow the unrestricted and unconditional access of the UN weapons inspection teams to all locations on Iraqi territory. There can be no compromise on this. These UN resolutions on Iraq represented a real step forward by beginning the process of monitoring and verifying disarmament. The UN showed what the future could hold in determining a safer world. If we were then, and are now, serious about this work, we must not allow Saddam Hussein to flout the international community.
</p>
<p class="contents">Secondly, my group believes that the only body legitimately responsible for this policy is the United Nations. We want to give our wholesale support to the UN and, in particular, we thank the Secretary General for the hard work and commitment he has shown in his attempt to solve this crisis through diplomatic and political pressure. We wish him well on his mission to Baghdad. We believe that it is the role of the United Nations Security Council to come together at this time to reconsider the Iraqi problem.
</p>
<p class="contents">I must tell you that there are some in my group who believe passionately that the United Nations, and only the United Nations, should decide what happens next. They argue against any military action without the sanction of the United Nations Security Council. Whilst they do not represent the majority in my group, be in no doubt that they do not argue that case from any weakening resolve to enforce existing UN resolutions; nor because they want to give Saddam Hussein any hope that he will be able to escape our determination to remove from him any potential to damn the region and the world with his weapons of mass destruction. Rather, they argue the need for a fresh UN mandate because they fear to inflict death and destruction on Iraqi civilians, who are the real losers in this; because they also fail to understand the objectives of a military strike against Iraq; and because they genuinely fear that a precipitate military strike may initiate a conflagration in the Middle East that would kill and destroy on scale not seen for many years. There is not one member of my group who does not share those dreads.
</p>
<p class="contents">For the great majority, however, we believe that the United Nations‐led drive for a political and diplomatic solution must be the focus for our parliamentary action at this moment.
</p>
<p class="contents">Thirdly, my group is committed to the food‐for‐oil programme and the additional programme which Kofi Annan has proposed to support the Iraqi people.
</p>
<p class="contents">I know that next Monday, 23 February, the General Affairs Council has the situation of Iraq on its agenda. I hear you saying that the Presidency has kept partners in the European Union informed. In our view, information is not enough. Parliament needs the Council to find a common position for the European Union. We recognize the difficulties; we recognize the lack of precision and real competence in the Treaty on European Union; but our Union is, if anything, a real model of conflict resolution.
</p>
<p class="contents">Please use every ounce of strength and vision which the Presidency can muster to give the European Union a leading role in the world on this issue. Give us a European Union of which its people can be proud. And please show us that the European Union means more than words in a treaty.

<span class="italic">
(DE)</span> Mr President, ladies and gentlemen, the brevity of the speech by the Commissioner Marín should perhaps be a symbolic expression of the fact that we have not much time left. I believe Mr President‐in‐Office of the Council that we should not lose sight of one thing: if the European Union were able to work out a common position then perhaps the message to Saddam Hussein would be clear, that he cannot play around with the world community.
</p>
<p class="contents">This is further proof that our inability to formulate common foreign and security policies does not lead to the avoidance of war but in fact makes it even more probable. Therefore, a greater ability on the part of Europeans to take action on such questions would be a gain for peace. I hope that will finally be understood by political directors and foreign ministers, so that sensible mechanisms can come into force for a common foreign and security policy.
</p>
<p class="contents">We would all like to have diplomatic solutions. A military conflict should be avoided. Therefore my group, too, is totally convinced that the mission to be undertaken on Friday by Kofi Annan must receive full support, in order to render a military conflict impossible. We wish him every success with it. But it must be clear that this must result in all United Nations resolutions being complied with and that there can be no compromise in the implementation of inspections designed to remove all weapons of mass destruction from Iraq.
</p>
<p class="contents">Iraq has biological and chemical weapons of mass destruction, associated with the development of rocket programmes which represent a danger not only to the immediate locality in the Middle East but in the medium and long term can be a great danger to ourselves and our peoples. For this reason there is great interest in their removal.
</p>
<p class="contents">We have the difficulty of choosing between options, not all of which are pleasant. But in my opinion, to do nothing and to let Saddam Hussein carry on ducking and diving as he has done for seven years with the world community, would lead to the spread of weapons of mass destruction and we sit there like paper tigers, who have lost any claim to authority in this world. For this reason it must be possible, if the resolutions of the United Nations are not fully recognised and implemented in the near future, to take further steps to compel Saddam Hussein to comply with the resolutions. If this should lead to military conflict it will not be the responsibility of those who want compliance with the will of the international community but of those who do not comply with decisions of the United Nations, that is Saddam Hussein. We should make this responsibility quite clear and stand behind these decisions.

<span class="italic">
(IT)</span> Mr President, Mr President‐in‐Office of the Council, Commissioner, ladies and gentlemen, I would like to give an example of consistency, but also one of cohesion, by both emulating Commissioner Marín and confirming everything that has been said, word for word, by Mrs Green. We have supported his resolution while preparing our own resolution on the same subject, because the appropriateness and validity of the things he has said are inevitable. Moreover, on certain subjects, we in this House must be determined, informed and responsible.
</p>
<p class="contents">Despite the exercises in dialectics and the ability we all have to provide our colleagues with comments and appraisals that certainly make the debate richer, at the end of our conversation there can only be one solution: to make everyone respect the resolutions of the UN Security Council.
</p>
<p class="contents">I believe that Saddam Hussein"s violation of such a resolution would seriously jeopardize the balances of civilian life and would bring further harm to a nation that is already suffering restrictions and facing uncertainties: this is another aspect we need to consider. On another occasion, we will have to assess such aspects, but at the moment, we should, above all, confirm that the resolutions of the UN Security Council will be respected by everyone.
</p>
<p class="contents">The occasion of today"s debate and in‐depth consideration of the matter also leads me to make an additional assessment that will not be the first and, unfortunately, I fear, not the last: the inadequacy, pointed out by Mrs Green, of our common foreign and security policy. This is a serious deficit which our institution should be able to face up to, particularly on account of the complementarity evident within the Union. We should invite each Registry of our Member States to reflect and to realize that this is a necessity, often highlighted for us by the events which occur from time to time.
</p>
<p class="contents">So what should we do? On behalf of my group, I hope that the Annan mission will be successful and, above all, I hope we will reflect on how we can rectify this inadequacy. We can reflect all the difficulties experienced by our continent, but we can also provide a significant, definitive example of what dialectics and, above all, peace and political and social cohesion mean.

<span class="italic">
(NL)</span> Mr President, the Liberal group attaches great importance to respect for international rule of law, and to the opinions and resolutions of the Security Council. This does not only apply to Iraq, but to other cases as well, in particular those near Iraq.
</p>
<p class="contents">It should be made clear to Saddam Hussein, persuasively, that he must allow unconditional and unrestricted access to the inspection teams. The integrity and independence of UNSCOM must be fully respected by Iraq. Saddam must have realized – yet he still manages to get away with it after years of obstruction – that we have reached our limits.
</p>
<p class="contents">The international community must act as unanimously as possible to give diplomatic pressure maximum effect. It would be better if military intervention were avoided, but effective pressure on people or dictators such as the one in Iraq is not possible without a credible military threat, and it is this military threat which can make a diplomatic success possible.

<p class="contents">Europe must play its part in this successful international approach. I must confess that it is just a touch embarrassing to note yet again that Europe is deeply divided on this. With all respect to the British Presidency, their role has not quite been played as we thought it should. The General Affairs Council will not speak about Iraq until Monday, and up until now the Presidency clearly did not think it was necessary to make the Union the forum for this matter. Of course, we still have not got a CSFP, and this kind of European unity might have made the difference. In the meantime, Iraq and Saddam are laughing up their sleeve.
</p>
<p class="contents">Let today"s opinion in this House be a first impulse towards a policy for joint European action which is propagated effectively and credibly, including within the context of the UN. France and Russia will have to understand that we cannot wait indefinitely for Iraq concessions which are not forthcoming. This undermines the international rule of law, creates a dangerous precedent, and saddles the world with large numbers of weapons of mass destruction. That is why the Union as a whole must support the US explicitly, exert credible pressure on Iraq and provide a clear strategy and contingency planning in case of military intervention.
</p>
<p class="contents">A longer term strategy therefore also requires that attention be focused on other countries in the region. There is no need for a new UN resolution for such intervention.

(GUE/NGL).</span> – Mr President, if the bombardment and invasion of Iraq by the United States and allied forces go ahead unilaterally as is planned this will be a multiple injustice.
</p>
<p class="contents">Firstly, it will kill many Iraqi citizens who are wholly innocent of any offence against the United States or its real or imagined interests. Secondly, if it is claimed that the dictatorial nature of the regime is the reason for military action, then there are significant numbers of other dictatorships against which action is not envisaged. Similarly, if a failure to respect United Nations resolutions were the criterion for war, then there are numerous other states to which the same reproach would apply. Thirdly, unilateral action will undermine and discredit the United Nations organization because only a Security Council decision can legitimate action against any Member State.
</p>
<p class="contents">Selective unilateral punishment missions have nothing to do with the development of international law. Further, the failure to explore the possibility of joint decisions by the European Union enfeebles and discredits the Union and exposes the institution of the Presidency‐in‐Office to serious reproach. In this case, the Presidency has unilaterally chosen what to do regardless of any other opinions which might exist in other Member States. All these serious problems are undermining the institutions of international law. The GUE group has proposed a joint resolution with the Greens and why we are launching an appeal to members of other political groups in this Parliament and to political parties, civil associations, churches and cultural bodies throughout Europe to oppose this military escalation and to urge all EC Member States to refuse to support it. Supporters of this appeal will be invited to come together to agree upon their plans to campaign for the condemnation of violent and illegal actions by individual states and to establish the sovereignty of the UN framework.

(SV)</span> Mr President, during the Gulf War in 1991, the USA and its allies dropped 277 000 tonnes of bombs over Iraq in 42 days. That did not dislodge Saddam Hussein's despotic totalitarian regime. Over the following seven years, Iraq has been subject to a massive international blockade. That has also failed to dislodge the military dictatorship. On the other hand, according to UNICEF, these measures have led to 4 500 children under the age of five dying each month. The infant mortality rate has increased from 24 to 98 per 1000 births. Cases of diseases like cholera, polio and jaundice have increased several times over. In a new survey, the Middle East Council of Churches says: ’The West wants to punish the leaders of Iraq, but the ones bearing all the burden are ordinary people’.
</p>
<p class="contents">Now the USA wants to hide its President's domestic problems through a new bombing war against Iraq, a war which is going to increase the suffering of the civilian population without solving the problem of weapons of mass destruction, and without paying any regard to the UN, which the USA systematically sabotages.
</p>
<p class="contents">Of course the Green group supports Kofi Annan. Of course we think that Iraq should comply with the UN's resolutions, but the same also applies to other states which are the subject of UN resolutions. Of course we want weapons of mass destruction out of Iraq. They should be out of all other countries too. We seek a just world order in which there may be a need for policing actions. However, that should be done by the UN, not unilaterally by the USA.
</p>
<p class="contents">How often have representatives of the party groups, which are now supporting the wishy‐washy, war‐mongering majority text, complained about the USA's world hegemony? How stubbornly have they demanded an effective EU alternative? But now, when the moment of truth has come, when the American master whistles, Green and Brok, Bertens and the others obediently wag their tales. That means that the EU is now helping the war of the civilizations: the West against the Arab‐Muslim world, because that is what it is going to be. The whole of the Arab world is now supporting Iraq, even its arch enemy Syria, not because they like Saddam Hussein, but because they see what is happening as an attack by the West against all of Arab‐Muslim culture.
</p>
<p class="contents">The EU 
<span class="italic">
could</span> have played an important, strategic role for peace. The EU could have come forward with a real alternative to the USA's ‚gunboat diplomacy’. But when it comes to the crunch, certain EU countries' old colonial cloven hooves peep out. The historical hatred of the Arabs wells up. The stale religious prejudices against Islam reach out and transform the EU's powerful elite into obedient slaves on the American triumphal chariot. That also means that the EU's good name – it has actually had a good name in the Arab world – will disappear. The trust in the EU in Palestine, where we have made a constructive contribution, will be sacrificed. The whole Mediterranean cooperation will be put at risk. It is tragic, it is deplorable, it is shameful. Support for the joint resolution from the Green group and GUE/NGL would be able to avoid all this.

(ARE).</span> – 
<span class="italic">
(FR)</span> Mr President, we are all aware that the political groups within our House are weighing up the exceptional responsibility they bear. Parliament has real power to influence peace or war, and I want to tell you why the Group of the European Radical Alliance took the decision unenthusiastically, but in full conscience of the various implications, to add its voice to the resolution which four groups have already supported.
</p>
<p class="contents">We have three motivating factors. Firstly we reject the caricature description of the Iraqi dictatorship on one hand, and the American imperialism on the other hand and do not come out in favour of either. Secondly, we believe that the European Union is not neutral in this conflict which has its beginnings in 1990, and that the question of our basic conception of liberty is at issue. Thirdly, whatever the cost to us, we consider that if Iraq does not fall into line with the UN resolutions as a result of diplomatic efforts, we should resort to military action, for if we do not, international law is no longer valid.
</p>
<p class="contents">And yet we are reluctant to go down this road, as are a number of Member States, as well as the Arab and Turkish allies of the United States. We know that those who are seeking to disarm Iraq were those who armed it in the first place, and that those who condemned the Iraqi exploits in Kuwait put up with the double protectorate imposed on Lebanon. We are also aware that the UNSCOM mission, in the eyes of many observers, is an American venture rather than a tool of the United Nations, that the current embargo and the future war influences or will influence the ordinary people much more than those in charge of them, and that the allies of the United States would suffer much more than America from a new international crisis.
</p>
<p class="contents">We know all this and we also deplore the British Presidency for believing it could express, without even a formal meeting of the General Affairs Council, its national prejudices and thereby stress the vacuity of the diplomacy of the Union. We know all this, but we take responsibility by voting for the resolution and insisting on the following points. Firstly, the UN alone has the power to force Iraq to observe the resolutions it has made. Secondly, any military intervention would only be legitimate if preceded by a decision by the Security Council. Thirdly, the Union should wholeheartedly support the mission of the UN Secretary General and reaffirm the absolute priority which it accords to diplomatic efforts.
</p>
<p class="contents">It is on the condition of these three points that our group will approve a text which explicitly includes the military solution as the only one capable of lending credibility to diplomatic pressure.

(I‐EDN).</span> – 
<span class="italic">
(FR)</span> Mr President, nations must be respected and peoples must not be humiliated; this is the basic rule of international life. This should be applied to all, and particularly to more fragile and less assured nations which the international community should not set out to weaken or destabilize but rather to strengthen, and which, in the Arab‐Muslim world, are the best counterweights which can be set against the development of Islamism.
</p>
<p class="contents">Beyond the person of Saddam Hussein, the international community must take into consideration above all Iraq and its integrity, the Iraqi people and its sovereignty.
</p>
<p class="contents">The international community must take care not to launch irresponsible actions which would be perceived as singling Iraq out with a suspect determination in a disproportionate violation of its sovereignty. It would strengthen the bonds between the Iraqi people and a large part of Arab opinion surrounding Saddam Hussein. It would provoke very hostile reactions towards the West from the Arab world and would risk stirring up the occupied territories. These consequences would be entirely out of proportion with the objectives of the inspections which, moreover, would not be met by a military strike.
</p>
<p class="contents">If, in fact, the real objective is the full application by the Iraqi authorities of the United Nations resolutions which call for the complete disarmament of the country, we must first note that Iraq today no longer represents a threat to the security of its neighbours. It no longer has any nuclear capability and its ballistic potential is under control. If the Security Council thinks it necessary to reinforce the inspections and controls to detect as far as possible any chemical and biological weapons which Iraq has in its possession, it should be possible to settle this residual question by political dialogue. This does not rule out pressure on or threats to a wily and disturbing dictator who remained in power in 1991, elements which could be useful in negotiations.
</p>
<p class="contents">This pressure would be all the more effective if Iraqis were encouraged to cooperate positively with the United Nations. And how better to do this than by proposing to put an end in a structured way to the unhealthy imprisonment of Iraq, caused by an embargo which for seven years has hit the population hard and whose complete failure we would now do well to acknowledge. The embargo has destabilized society, but not Saddam Hussein, nor the political and military elite of the regime. It has destroyed production and trade channels and at the same time reinforced the links between Saddam Hussein and his people. Lifting the embargo is essential and I am delighted that some European diplomatic efforts are proposing just that whilst they are actively participating in the political dialogue with Iraq. At the same time, they recall that it is up to the Security Council alone to judge the degree to which Iraq has adopted its resolutions and to draw the appropriate conclusions about this.
</p>
<p class="contents">Of course, these diplomatic efforts do not all speak with one voice, but they speak loudly, and this is how Europe in all its diversity comes to be an important player in this crisis. Europe makes itself heard and intervenes with the aid of its most active Member States in such a way as to be much more effective than if it had tried hard to define a common position for all. Any such position would have risked being too weak and too slow to emerge when a crisis, such as the one we are facing at the moment, calls for a swift judgement and a rapid reaction.

(IT)</span> Mr President, ladies and gentlemen, I am sorry to have to point out that, once again, we are called upon to repeat a useless practice that risks, if it has not already done so, lacking any specific confirmation, owing to the total lack of a credible foreign policy common to the fifteen Member States. We realize that it is not easy to make the political strategies followed by the states in past decades compatible, with histories and interests that are often different if not hostile, but we regret the absence of any effort to minimize differences on the basis of common, irrenounceable principles.
</p>
<p class="contents">Firstly, as regards respect for international treaties and agreements, the American ally cannot be used when it is convenient and then discarded when appropriate. There is a saying in Italian: “clear agreements and long friendship’. So, we need clear agreements with all our allies.
</p>
<p class="contents">Secondly, we need to consider respect for human rights, a flower in the eye of Parliament. We should ensure that the bilateral agreements between individual states and countries which do not offer any guarantee to that effect, should no longer take place, particularly when they have to be made with countries such as Iraq that have destructive military arsenals which place the populations of an entire region in danger.
</p>
<p class="contents">Thirdly, the UN should have an ever more significant and important duty, particularly at diplomatic level, to ensure that its prerogative remains intact and that its resolutions are accepted without any hesitation or delay by all those who have signed the accession.
</p>
<p class="contents">Having said that, it is obvious that the National Alliance delegation can only hope for the successful outcome of the current diplomatic initiatives, particularly the initiative whose deadline is nearly up, led by the UN Secretary General, Kofi Annan, whom no‐one can consider to be under any influences. This is particularly so to avoid the catastrophic effects of a conflict that would force the civilian population into great discomfort, particularly the weaker sections – the children and the elderly – who are still paying harshly for the effects of the previous war.

<span class="italic">
(DE)</span> Mr President, Mr President‐in‐Office of the Council, Vice‐President Marín, I believe that each and every one of us in this House feels revulsion for Saddam Hussein and his regime. There can be no doubt about that. Nevertheless, we must be clear, in view of the political climate, especially in the Arab world, when and on what conditions a military strike can be successful. In my view, Europe must insist on three things, in solidarity with but certainly not in subordination to the policy of America.
</p>
<p class="contents">Firstly, the aim of any military strike must be clear. So far, it has not become clear to me. We must be as sure as possible that after a military strike the situation will be better for peace and better for the development of the whole Middle East region.
</p>
<p class="contents">Secondly, there is no question that the situation in the Middle East is not improving but deteriorating. This has been pointed out frequently by the EU and in particular Commissioner Marín, as well as the President‐in‐Office of the Council. A few years ago it was still possible to organize as many Arab countries as possible in a coalition against Saddam Hussein, which is impossible today. It is a fact that we have a policy of obstruction by the Netanyahu government; it is a fact, without making comparisons, that even Israel does not recognise and does not implement a UN resolution concerning the Lebanon. This produces a negative atmosphere in the Arab world and we must be clear that any strike which is not properly thought out, extremely well considered and well supported will make this atmosphere even worse. Europe must bear that in mind.
</p>
<p class="contents">Lastly, as regards the role of the United Nations, I would not like to say now that it is essential to have a Security Council resolution. There are various legal interpretations there. But we must all be clear about one thing: the weaker the consensus in the Security Council and the United Nations, the more negative any effects will be, particularly on the relationship between the West and the Arab world. It must be Europe"s task to get America to support the United Nations fully, now in the case of this mission, but also in the Security Council, to ensure as broad a consensus as possible; otherwise, the military strike becomes a slap in the face of the Arabs and ultimately also a slap in the face of the Europeans who seek a good relationship with this region.

<span class="italic">
(NL)</span> Mr President, I would like to say how nice it was to hear the President‐in‐Office of the Council give us an informative statement on the situation. We had already read this in the papers. We would rather have heard a few different things, because the more important and more critical the topic, the less visible the Foreign Affairs Council is. This is a dangerous situation.
</p>
<p class="contents">When something does come out of the Council, it seems to be fragile compromises which may be different again tomorrow and which are not really shared. As the world expects something a little better from the European Union since we are an economic giant, it is extremely dangerous that the Council is this invisible. The European citizens, according to the opinion polls, think that the European Union is above all responsible for foreign affairs. This is a very logical thought, really, but sadly a misunderstanding, because the Foreign Affairs Council and the Union do not really accept this responsibility. That is why the Council is usually not part of the solution, but part of the problem. The British Presidency – from which we had expected a fresh, new approach – could have made an attempt to avoid this being part of the problem.
</p>
<p class="contents">Unfortunately, the British Presidency has only acted nationally, and has actually forgotten its duty as leader of foreign policy of the Union. Like a proud terrier, Great Britain is walking next to the American elephant, and is saying: listen to us making all this noise. If there is anything that can contribute to avoiding war, it is a solid European Union action. This can achieve something. We need a solid European Union action that leaves no room for false hopes or manipulation by tyrants. There was certainly none of this clarity in Bosnia. The British position is clearer now; oil is involved. In Bosnia, British officers told me at the time, oil did not play a part. That was a terrible position, but it is clearer now. Thank God. But only as the position of the country itself. There is no European Union, or Council position regarding Iraq or regarding Algeria. Parliament"s resolution must now add something to this unusual situation in order to fill the vacuum a little.

(IT)</span> Mr President, ladies and gentlemen, it is a euphemism, I believe, to state that the legitimacy of the Baghdad regime, suspected of crimes against humanity, crimes of war and crimes of genocide is doubtful at least. In a more general context, it is a fact that Saddam Hussein is trying to justify himself in the eyes of world public opinion, and the developing countries in particular, as a symbol of the combat against American imperialism, and Western imperialism more generally, in a black and white view of the world that belongs to another era.
</p>
<p class="contents">The point should be made that no‐one in Europe wants or can want war with Iraq. The diplomatic solution to the crisis is certainly far more preferable. But it is for this precise reason that it is absolutely necessary, as already confirmed by several parties, that the European Union and the individual Member States should make up for the guilty and self‐interested inertia of some authoritative members of the international Community with all their authority.
</p>
<p class="contents">At the same time, the European Union should not leave the United States and the United Kingdom the monopoly on handling the crisis on the Western side. For this reason, the elusive nature of the General Affairs Council and even the brevity of the declarations made by the representative for the Commission amaze me somewhat.
</p>
<p class="contents">Politics, particularly international politics, abhors a vacuum; we will not contribute towards creating it. Otherwise, if this vacuum is occupied by others, we will have to deal with it ourselves.

However, I would like to know whether we also share the view that the United Nations should be the only ones to make that happen, and whether we also agree that they should do it peacefully, through political and diplomatic means.
</p>
<p class="contents">Of course, we support the efforts of the United Nations Secretary General, Kofi Annan, but I hope those efforts do not end up being the victim of friendly fire. In other words, Mr Annan"s trip to Baghdad might end up being the excuse for US military action, which is unacceptable from every point of view, both because of the consequences it would have for the civilian population and, of course, because of the effects it would have on stability in the Middle East.
</p>
<p class="contents">The role of the European Union in this matter is quite frankly regrettable. The British Presidency is embarking upon an exercise in confusion in order to guarantee their national policy which, quite frankly, is to do what the White House says. And what can we say about other Member States of the European Union, beginning with my own country, Spain, where the Head of Government has witnessed his citizens receiving an explanation of Madrid"s participation in a hypothetical US operation via Tony Blair through the CNN?
</p>
<p class="contents">The Union should of course have a common position on this matter, which should include opposing any unilateral US action and, of course, lifting an embargo which is causing indescribable suffering to the ordinary citizens of Iraq. They are being punished twice over: they have to endure a brutal dictatorial regime, and they lack the foods and medicines to cope with daily life.
</p>
<p class="contents">We should support the democratic opposition in Iraq, of course. And this Parliament ought to make sure that if Clinton undertakes a military operation without the support of a United Nations Security Council resolution that he will not be able to end up finding support in a resolution from this Parliament.

Some of us were opposing him when Britain and the US were arming him. This includes the chemical and biological warfare which Doug Henderson spoke about this morning. We know they have it, we sold it to them.
</p>
<p class="contents">Let us end all chemical and biological warfare and destroy all weapons around the world. Let us inspect all sites around the world including those in the USA and in Britain which still exist. Let us be clear what this crisis is about. It is not about the threat from Iraq. It is about Mr Clinton's domestic problems. This is the war of Mr Clinton's penis, designed to bolster his image in the face of allegations about his character back home.
</p>
<p class="contents">How ironic then that Mr Clinton's main backer is Mr Blair, Mr Clean the Christian socialist, and how disgraceful that Mr Blair, the President of the European Union, has made no attempt to represent the views of Europe but seeks to impose the views of Mr Clinton on Europe. How sad and pathetic it is to watch Robin Cook, the British Foreign Secretary, instead of travelling around Europe to help stop the war, trailing around the Gulf States to persuade them to let the US and Britain bomb Baghdad. What an end to a man who made his name as a CND and peace campaigner!
</p>
<p class="contents">The 
<span class="italic">
Financial Times</span> this morning reports that Foreign Office officials brief that Britain is prepared to use nuclear weapons against Iraq if Saddam responds. Let this Parliament speak clearly against this unnecessary war. The joint resolution of the EPP and the PSE does not go far enough. I understand that Pauline Green has been privately critical of Mr Blair's belligerence over Iraq. Let us be openly critical of the British failure to act as the President of Europe rather than the fifty‐second state of the US. Let us say that bombing Baghdad will not work and is morally unjustifiable.

Remember that not only will your Labour party members judge you, but history will judge how you vote on this issue. I appeal to you to vote for peace, for a diplomatic solution and against the war.

(FR)</span> Mr President, it seems as though the United States of America is preparing quite imperturbably to lead a new war in the Gulf and to strike Iraq, against international law, against the United Nations Charter, against the resolutions of the Security Council and particularly resolution 687 which refutes their mandate to do so.
</p>
<p class="contents">What can justify this sudden, unilateral, arrogant and cynical policy? And why now when the situation seemed to be improving? Is Mr Clinton trying to forget the Paula Jones and Monica Lewinsky affairs, where the shocking and the sordid have competed for our attention? Or is it on orders from Mr Netanyahu, whose disregard for the Security Council resolutions does not arouse any emotion from you, Mr President‐in‐Office of the Council? Or again, is it a question of preserving the profitability of American oil‐wells, half of which would have to close if, as forecast, Iraqi oil came back onto the world market? In any case, contrary to the official lies, one thing is sure: these threats are not justified by the danger which Iraq would represent.
</p>
<p class="contents">No prima facie evidence on this subject has even begun to be provided. This country with 20 million inhabitants has been methodically starved for seven years. There are no more spare parts. For seven years, no aeroplanes or helicopters have taken off. Industry is paralyzed. To get to the capital, you have to cross 900 kilometres of desert in terrible conditions. There are no more electric bulbs, there is no more bread, there is no more milk.
</p>
<p class="contents">Pencils have even been confiscated from schools because it is said that Saddam Hussein would make atomic bombs from graphite mines!
</p>
<p class="contents">The most upsetting thing about it all is not the American lies, but your servility, Mr President of the Council. Let us at least get rid of your loathsome morals. Let us get rid of your alibi. Let us get rid of the political and media montages which took place during the Gulf War. If you wish to go to war with your American friends, go ahead, but go without us!

(IT)</span> Madam President, Mr President‐in‐Office of the Council, I am sorry that the British Government has unilaterally and immediately declared that it is prepared to take part in a military action, without consulting the European governments and seeking a common position. At a time when it is responsible for the Presidency of the European Union, this is a harsh blow to the role and credibility of the Union.
</p>
<p class="contents">The joint resolution of several political groups calls us to this responsibility today; it calls us to define a common position, to support all diplomatic means, particularly the missions of the UN and its Secretary General, and its proposal of oil in return for food directed at the population.
</p>
<p class="contents">Finally, and this is the central point, the resolution asks for any further action that is not diplomatic to require the formal decision of the UN Security Council, the sole interpreter. This is an essential point. We are convinced of the extreme danger Saddam Hussein poses and the need to force him to observe the UN resolutions. However, the Security Council has to decide how and when, assessing the situation which is different in both military and political terms today than it was during the Gulf War.
</p>
<p class="contents">The situation is different today as regards military resources. I can give two examples of this: what effects will striking chemical arms deposits have? Minister Primakoff talks of devastating effects over the entire region. This is a point that should be assessed. Another example is that UN sources indicate that Saddam has hidden chemical missiles and arms in Algeria, Libya and Sudan. If that is true, what does he intend to do with those countries and how can it help to bombard Iraq?
</p>
<p class="contents">The situation is also different in terms of politics. All the Arab countries, and first and foremost our allies, are against this. Why? We can take action against them, but with what consequences throughout the Middle East? The Security Council should assess all this and then its decisions will be applied. Each of us will then do our parts.

(IT)</span> Madam President, Kofi Annan"s trip to Baghdad gives us a glimpse of rationality and hope: rationality because, in the last few weeks, war has been considered inevitable on almost all sides, in view of Saddam Hussein"s unacceptable arrogance.
</p>
<p class="contents">As Clinton said yesterday, war is never the first option, even if it may be the only option in certain situations. Thanks to the persistence of some countries, to the attitude of UN public union, to the strong calls from the solitary moral authority of the Pope in Rome, to the worrying and foreseeable agreement between Russia and China and to the resistance of the Arab countries, the policy seems to be taking over its responsibility very recently.
</p>
<p class="contents">Unfortunately, we cannot thank Europe for this because, once again, Europe, which is preparing to become a monetary power, is not managing to become a political power, not even when faced with a crisis that could provide it with more than we believe today. For this reason, I am joining all those who have criticized the inexplicable and unacceptable behaviour of the British Presidency in these circumstances.
</p>
<p class="contents">Let it be clear that no‐one doubts the need for the Baghdad dictator to be forced to observe all the UN resolutions. However, the usefulness and effectiveness of the methods used to achieve the result, the balance of foreseeable human costs and the simulation of subsequent political scenarios can never be considered indisputable and inevitable. When the alternative is war, indisputable limits to the patience of diplomacy and politics cannot be invoked. This is not a weakness, but is the strength that shows us the old moral and political wisdom of this ancient continent and the only serious lesson left behind by the century that is drawing to a close.

(GUE/NGL).</span> – Madam President, we cannot but express astonishment and dismay about what we have heard today, particularly from the British Foreign Office gentleman. We read the same papers he reads about the weapons of mass destruction, British‐developed anthrax and the inflated threats against humanity.
</p>
<p class="contents">We also know the role his government has played, first to block, then to hinder the mission in Iraq of the Secretary General, Kofi Annan. We learn that the use of incredible force to produce a diplomatic solution has long ceased to be a threat to achieve anything at all, as the juggernaut of American military power moves inexorably and with devastating force against the Iraqi people: there are one and a half million victims of the embargo, an embargo that somebody in this House wants to prolong forever.
</p>
<p class="contents">On this side of the House, we nurture no sympathy for the Baghdad dictator. We still hope that Mr Annan might perform a miracle. We deplore, in the strongest terms, the veil of hypocrisy and mystification drawn over this pre‐planned massacre, over this tragedy of major proportions and, more than anything else, over the attempted use of this Union to support blind instruments of Anglo‐ American military and foreign policies at their worst.

(FR)</span> Mr President, ladies and gentlemen, it is totally disgraceful to claim that Iraq would really threaten its neighbours with what remains of an arsenal which has been voluntarily overestimated by Israeli‐American disinformation. There can be no doubt that this country, if it were to launch a war of aggression, would suffer dreadful destructive reprisals from Israel and the United States immediately.
</p>
<p class="contents">Having led Saddam Hussein into the trap of recapturing Kuwait, the United States hammered the derisory Iraqi army with their might. And since then, they have been starving the Iraqi people and causing the deaths of children by the hundreds of thousands, soon to reach two million, using a procedure which constitutes a crime against humanity. It is all the more terrible in that it is perpetrated coldly, calmly and clinically and has operated down the years under the cover of moral pacifist motivations which claim human rights as their inspiration.
</p>
<p class="contents">We know that the reality is that with cynicism covered in a thick layer of hypocrisy, Mr Clinton is obeying first and foremost the cold interests of oil mercantilism which Iraqi production must not threaten, not to mention his own murky personal motivations.
</p>
<p class="contents">Finally, and above all, if Saddam Hussein did not exist, he would have to be invented. Israel and the United States think they need a constant virtual enemy and a war which might always break out. Today Saddam, tomorrow someone else. Comprehension of this is the key to the whole situation, but it also brings understanding of the danger for world peace. So who could negate the legitimacy of Palestinian exasperation and the rising anger of the most moderate and responsible Arab movements?

(DE)</span> Madam President, ladies and gentlemen, in my contribution I would like to say something about the role of the European Union and our House in this conflict. The question is, do we play a part at all, or do we do it justice? The fact is that we do not play an active role, but nevertheless I think that our debate and the joint resolution which we present today are an important contribution, for we in the European Parliament will reach a decision before the Council and the Commission have been able to work out a common position. This is the umpteenth time that the Council and the Commission have not been able to find a common position and if the Commission, as we have heard this morning, limits itself to wishing and hoping then the Commission appears to be in a bad way.
</p>
<p class="contents">In our resolution we demand a common position on a common foreign and security policy, but we also say in this resolution how we view this. In any case, it involves a resolution put forward by a majority in our House and, as already mentioned, adopted before the Council and the Commission are in a position to put forward some kind of common text for discussion.
</p>
<p class="contents">I would like to make a comment on the UN resolution. The Americans hold the view that we must intervene if all diplomatic efforts fail, and that we shall intervene. In our House, and this has been said, there are some who dispute this. It is to be hoped that further measures against the dictator will be supported by the whole international community. It would also be desirable for the UN Security Council to confirm such a measure. But this effort must not lead to some members of the international community, such as Russia and China, bringing the Security Council into a position whereby the pressure on Saddam can be reduced, which would mean state terrorism being victorious in Iraq. We do not want that. We want, if possible, a peaceful solution, and hopefully a common one, which will mean that all those things indicated some time ago by the British Presidency disappear from the world. Chemical and biological weapons cannot be accepted anywhere in the world, and certainly not in a country where there is state terrorism.

(FR)</span> Mr President‐in‐Office, Madam President, ladies and gentlemen, the refusal of Iraq to comply with the decisions of the UN can only be condemned firmly and without ambiguity by any country or parliament. Respect for international law is the condition for peace, all the more so because in this case we are dealing with highly dangerous weapons.
</p>
<p class="contents">But who could refuse or regret exhausting all possible diplomatic and political efforts before using force to put these weapons out of action to prevent them causing harm in case negotiations failed? I congratulate and approve of the efforts of those who push negotiation to its limits, especially the French government and the Secretary General of the UN. We could already make a number of observations about this crisis.
</p>
<p class="contents">Firstly, was Iraq capable of manufacturing these terrible arms on its own, or was it aided by other members of the UN? Secondly, once again Europe is incapable of adopting a European position. In terms of international politics, Europe does not exist, and this shortcoming can only be compensated for by the Member States. They do this in the light of their individual histories and respective sensibilities, and these are not identical. And so they are forced to draw up policies, not in terms of their common analysis, but which relate to those of the United States.
</p>
<p class="contents">Your attitude, Mr President‐in‐Office, that of your government, was of particular significance in this respect, and I would like to know what you have done in your role as President of the European Council, and not as the British government, with regard to the Arab countries, with regard to the Soviet Union, with regard to China, with regard to the UN and in general within the European Union.
</p>
<p class="contents">Thirdly, must we go to war with Iraq every ten years, or will we learn from the first Gulf War and from the present situation to reflect on the issues of the balance of forces in the region, the law of each country and its security, the role of oil in this crisis, the influence of blocking the peace process on the general situation in the Middle East, the use of an embargo on Iraq, and the situation of the Iraqi population which is hostage both to its dictator and to the West?
</p>
<p class="contents">If Europe existed, it would certainly have been able to do something to direct the situation during the past ten years in order to avoid the current tragic deadlock. But we persist in deploring our impotence without taking decisions which are of the same order as the stakes. Do you not agree, for example, that the election of the President of the European Council for a period of four years would be a first practical step in drawing up a real common and foreign security policy?

I fear that we are talking too much here and looking for excuses that there is no common foreign policy, and that is why there is none or rather, through the current Presidency, that it is a party to Clinton's war games.
</p>
<p class="contents">Madam President, I think that notwithstanding the above, this Parliament could pass a resolution which firstly categorically opposes any military intervention in Iraq – regardless of the situation, whether reprehensible, etcetera – and secondly, defends in the same integrated way a political and diplomatic solution. Instead of that, however, the four groups have a resolution which in one way or another very cunningly creates the prerequisites for its use as a fig‐leaf for military intervention by the Americans. Meanwhile, the resolution by the Greens and our own group totally condemns, in fact, any military intervention and supports a political and diplomatic solution, which is the best form of support for Annan in the mission he has now undertaken by going to Baghdad.

This is worrying, a very worrying crisis! Just think that seven years ago Saddam Hussein could have been calmly removed from power and yet the power that could have done so did not do it; things have progressed over the years and now we are in this situation.
</p>
<p class="contents">We have the duty to reassure our nations that there will be no ecological disasters; we all know how bombardment starts: it is hoped to be surgical but then becomes devastating. We cannot even hold a nation hostage in the hope that this nation will cause the dictator to fall, because this is not the right way of seeing things. Unfortunately, there are too many people like Saddam Hussein and the dictators who oppress the rights of their nations in the world today. In this specific case, as well as the risk of bacteriological or any other type of warfare, Saddam also has the grave responsibility of holding one‐fifth of the population of his country, the Kurds, under a humanely unacceptable regime.
</p>
<p class="contents">I ask Parliament to declare this and, with regard to the people I represent, the people of the Po Valley, we are against the use of any base that is situated in our territory.

(NL)</span> Mr President, it is a good thing that the European Parliament is defining its position on the Iraq crisis. It appears that the Council has not really managed to do so. The starting position as regards Iraq is fairly clear. We have a pariah state which does not take any notice of the international community, and refuses to meet UN declarations which demand that the weapons of mass destruction be inspected and destroyed. This is simply unacceptable. It requires international action: that is what we are discussing here.
</p>
<p class="contents">What action is the world taking to rid Saddam Hussein of his deadly arsenal? This issue concerns everyone, not just America. The compromise resolution before us deals with a number of fundamental questions. Should you threaten violence in a situation like this? Should it be used as a last resort, if diplomacy fails? Yes. Should you use all peaceful means for a solution? Again, I believe so, and I am also glad that there is agreement about a last attempt by Kofi Annan, the United Nations Secretary General. Should you be prepared to use violence if a diplomatic avenue does not lead to the concessions demanded of Saddam Hussein? My answer is, albeit reluctantly, yes. Should the Security Council approve such an action? It is desirable, but not an absolute condition. The Security Council should play a part, but there is a difference of opinion about the interpretation of the UN resolutions on Iraq. Saddam Hussein should not be allowed to benefit from the confusion. The compromise resolution before us is a perfect expression of this notion. Our aim is not war, but there are limits to the international community"s patience.

(DE)</span> Madam President, Mr President‐in‐Office of the Council, ladies and gentlemen, I would like to say first of all that I find it extraordinarily regrettable that Commissioner Marín has already left the House. In any case, he was here for the commentary. He could easily be here and speak in somewhat greater detail in a final speech on certain humanitarian measures and suchlike; I very much regret that he did not feel that this was necessary. On the other hand, I am of course very happy that the discussion is being held here today, since it is simply high time that we in Europe speak with one voice – I am very happy, Commissioner Marín, that you are again with us –, that we speak with one voice on a subject that has already been described by CNN as the “showdown in the Gulf’. I sometimes wish that this one voice were rather more harmonious and somewhat louder. Nevertheless, it is good that it is actually happening.
</p>
<p class="contents">I am also sure that many colleagues present yesterday saw two things on television which were interesting: on the one hand, the permanent members of the Security Council dispatching Secretary General, Kofi Annan, and the good advice which he has taken with him; and on the other hand, the speech which President Bill Clinton made to officers in the Pentagon, in which he very clearly threatened Saddam Hussein. We must be clear on one point: the journey of this Secretary General must undoubtedly not turn into a flop like the one made by the Secretary General in 1991, which was practically the introduction to the Gulf War. I can only hope that lessons were learned from these mistakes. We should also make our opinion clear in the sense that only on the basis of clear concessions can we really exhaust all diplomatic possibilities of preventing this war.
</p>
<p class="contents">However, we must make quite clear our attitude to those states which are using biological weapons. Here I would point out that Iraq itself has anthrax at its disposal as its main weapon. Anyone who has observed in our own continent the effects of anthrax over 50 years ago in Scotland on Anthrax Island, understands that it is really necessary for us to speak with one voice here, because we cannot foresee these effects, nor do we want to foresee them.

They tell the IRA terrorists in my country that they can hold on to their weapons which have murdered my constituents, both Roman Catholic and Protestant, and be welcomed at the White House and Downing Street. Yet they tell us today that Iraq must have its weapons destroyed.
</p>
<p class="contents">I want to put on record that none of us dare forget that Saddam has proved by the murderous slaughter of his own people that he would use mass destruction weapons if he had the chance. I do not know whether an air strike can take out all these weapons, but for us to start again without finishing would be disastrous. That is what happened before. It must not happen again.

(FR)</span> Madam President, after “Desert Storm’ here we are again on the brink of a new intervention in Iraq led by the United States of America. The Iraqi dictator is flouting the international community once more. He refuses to comply with the UN resolutions. He has brought about plans for a formidable threat to the region. There my parallel ends.
</p>
<p class="contents">In 1990, the UN authorized force to be used under Chapter 7. Intervention was implemented by a broad coalition which included in particular neighbouring Arab countries and also many non‐aligned countries. And Europe as such was present, active notably through the voice of the Presidency and of the troika which did not carefully handle its efforts and turned up in Baghdad in spite of certain reservations shown particularly in this Parliament. Today I note that Europe has been obliterated, as spectacularly indicated, Mr Marín, by the terseness of your remarks earlier. I note especially the obliteration of the British Presidency, Mr President‐in‐Office. Prime Minister Blair is doubtless very active and omnipresent, however President Blair has disappeared. It seems as if the common foreign and security policy no longer exists when things become serious.
</p>
<p class="contents">I would add that the coalition comes from the West alone and that the United States seems to have decided to act without any mandate from the UN, despite a half‐hearted blessing given to the last chance mission of the Secretary General of the UN, Kofi Annan, which we obviously hope will be fruitful.
</p>
<p class="contents">Under these conditions, an intervention would indicate a serious weakening of the authority of the United Nations and of the presence of the European Union, which has become a negligible quantity in world terms. Some of us are not prepared under these conditions to give carte blanche to the United States of America for this operation.

(PPE).</span> – Madam President, it is quite clear that there is a consensus emerging in the Chamber, which gives me no pleasure, and that is the criticism of the Presidency. We have just heard from a leading French socialist the sort of words I might use myself.
</p>
<p class="contents">There is confusion. I remember the last time we debated Iraq in substance during the Gulf War. At that time, all but six of the Labour Members signed a resolution condemning the military action in the Gulf. This time, only six would sign up to one. So, this is the sort of changing pattern one sees on the socialist side of this House.
</p>
<p class="contents">It is regrettable and deplorable that, so far, the Presidency has failed to arrive at a common position. But it reflects the lack of certainty in foreign policy, both in Washington and London, and, I regret, elsewhere in Europe. The sort of certainty that was so evident in the days of Mrs Thatcher and President Bush; the sort of certainty that was brought to the European Union by Douglas Hurd, when he was Foreign Secretary; the sort of certainty we actually need today. I regret, therefore, that Robin Cook has not found it possible to come here, although he spent the whole of yesterday afternoon in the House of Commons.
</p>
<p class="contents">These are shifting sands. We do not know how the next few days are going to turn out. We know that in that part of the world there is little to choose between two despotic regimes, one in Iran and one in Iraq.
</p>
<p class="contents">Criticism has been made of the supply of material to the Iraqis. In the case of the United Kingdom, that stopped in 1988. But we are dealing here with a dictator, who has at his disposal weapons, some of which were invented as far back as the First World War. It is First World War technology with a barbarian mentality, and this needs to be dealt with by the international community.
</p>
<p class="contents">Therefore, we feel that the present diplomatic mission by Kofi Annan needs every support. We understand the position, reflected here on my own benches: by Mr Castagnetti and Mr Bernard‐Reymond, from Italy and France, and other Mediterranean countries in particular are deeply concerned about the dangers of the present situation. But we cannot allow Saddam Hussein to continue to have the ability to threaten not only his own people but those neighbouring his country and even much further afield with the technology he has been trying to develop.
</p>
<p class="contents">We deeply sympathize with the people of Iraq. We hope the humanitarian efforts will continue and if it is necessary in the coming days to take further measures, as enjoined by the resolution we are about to adopt, then I believe the House here and the people of Europe should stand behind those forces, as I do, whether they are American, British or others, if the time comes – and the time is coming – when we must finish the job we began in 1991.

(PSE).</span> – Madam President, in my nine years in this Parliament I have never before heard a speech of such distorted, selfindulgent drivel as that which Mr Kerr gave a short while ago. I now know that care in the community in the United Kingdom does not work.
</p>
<p class="contents">I ask this Chamber to consider for one moment the effect of just one Scud missile with chemical weapons aimed at Israel. The conflagration in the Middle East resulting from that Scud missile is beyond imagination. We must be clear in this Chamber that international law must be adhered to. There should be no comfort for Saddam Hussein in our debate. He is the person not adhering to UN resolutions. It is no good claiming that in other areas the UN has been less rigorous. Two wrongs do not make a right.
</p>
<p class="contents">I am also perturbed by the weeping and gnashing of teeth by Members of Parliament over the CFSP. CFSP does not mean, as Mr Bertens says, that we should be united on every issue. It means that we should have a common strategy towards common threats to the European Union. It is clear that the European Union has been moving in that direction. The common text we have before us is united in making sure that Saddam Hussein is clearly identified as being in the wrong; that there has to be implementation of UN resolutions. There has to be an exhaustive search for a diplomatic solution. We have to support the UN Secretary General in his mission.
</p>
<p class="contents">Can Mr Henderson confirm that, in fact, that is also the common position of the Council? Could he also confirm that the Presidency has acted entirely in conformity with Article J.5 of the Treaty on European Union and, in addition, that the British government has adhered to its obligations under Article J.5, paragraph 4, as a member of the Security Council?
</p>
<p class="contents">We must be clear: Saddam Hussein must be stopped. We must have a diplomatic solution to this problem. But at the end, if there is no possibility of a diplomatic solution, the military option must be considered as a very last resort.

It would, however, be a massive mistake for the United States to bomb Iraq. It is not certain to eliminate the weaponry; it could inflict casualties and further suffering on innocent civilians; it would alienate supporters, divide the European Union and inflame Arab opinion, already aggrieved at the different standards applied to Israel; fundamentalism and terrorism will gain and could escalate.
</p>
<p class="contents">No military action should be taken anyway without the explicit and full agreement of the United Nations Security Council, which must meet again on this issue. We also need to increase food and medical supplies to the Iraqi people by extending the oil‐for‐food programme. The European Union must formulate its own foreign policy, not supinely follow the United States, particularly when the United States is wrong.

This House seeks a diplomatic solution to the Iraqi crisis and welcomes the work Kofi Annan is undertaking to resolve it. But Iraq should know that if it does not allow UNSCOM to continue its vital work, the real threat of military action will remain.
</p>
<p class="contents">Saddam must destroy all remaining stocks of chemical and biological weapons and the potential to develop other weapons of mass destruction, including nuclear weapons. This includes some 31 000 chemical weapons and 45 missiles unaccounted for. Saddam has used these weapons before, as we have heard, both against his own people and Iran. He must never be allowed to use weapons of mass destruction again.

(SV)</span> Madam President, countries should be founded on law. That also applies to the international community. International law must be respected by everyone, not just by some. Saddam Hussein should, of course, comply with the Security Council's resolution.
</p>
<p class="contents">The UN Charter permits the use of force as a last resort, but only after a resolution by the UN Security Council. Therefore, it is important that no green light be given for any military bombing by the USA. Every intelligent general should ask himself this question: what is the objective? Is it to remove weapons or to remove Saddam Hussein? Will this be achieved through bombs? The answer is certainly no. What will happen after the bombing? What will happen to Iraq's population? Will Saddam Hussein's position not in fact be stronger after a bombing?
</p>
<p class="contents">It is excellent that all five permanent members of the Security Council support Kofi Annan's journey to Iraq and diplomatic solutions. Diplomacy works slowly. The UN 
<span class="italic">
has</span> removed a lot of weapons and will also be able to do so in future. We must, as former President Carter said, have patience, patience, patience.

(ES)</span> Madam President, Mr President‐in‐Office of the Council, Mr Vice‐President of the Commission, ladies and gentlemen, the unfortunate matter we are discussing should lead us to reflect on certain things. It is true, none of these things are particularly useful as regards the actual situation, because it is not in our power to decide, or almost not even to comment.
</p>
<p class="contents">However, Mr President‐in‐Office of the Council, I think there is one aspect which we should be very concerned about: the way we Europeans have acted so ineffectively in regard to this serious issue. In your speech, Mr President‐in‐Office, you spoke several times of a united Europe. There can be no doubt that this has been a disunited Europe. I have the impression that the Council, under its worthy Presidency, has not taken the necessary steps to achieve a certain common position, far less a joint action. And it seems to me – and to many other Europeans – that this has been a wasted opportunity in that respect.
</p>
<p class="contents">It would have been perfectly feasible to have formed a common opinion because the interests of all Europeans are largely the same, apart from the natural entrepreneurial exploits which may sometimes be inspired by lust for Iraq"s oil, for example. I think the Council – its President – should take advantage of this opportunity to analyse why, when faced with such dramatic and urgent circumstances, it was really not possible to formulate a rough outline which a truly united Europe – that united Europe you have mentioned so often, Mr President‐in‐Office – could have used to respond to the crisis situation we are all so worried and upset about.

<span class="italic">
President‐in‐Office of the Council</span>. – Madam President, thank you for the opportunity to reply to this very important debate. I would firstly confirm that our Presidency has fulfilled its obligations under Article J.5(4) in the Treaty of Maastricht in that we have kept other members of the Union fully informed of positions on which we have expressed a view and, where it has been possible to identify European Union positions, we have defended those positions in our representations.
</p>
<p class="contents">Secondly, I confirm that many actions have been taken by the Presidency to try to build a common position within the European Union. In my introductory address I outlined a number of initiatives which have been taken, including those by the Prime Minister, the Foreign Secretary, myself and many of our officials. That process has taken place over a period of time in the build‐up to this week. In Panama last week the Foreign Secretary, in his capacity as President‐in‐Office, held a meeting with other Member States who were represented there. This informal meeting was to go over the ground where a common position could be identified. As it was not a formal Council, it was not possible to have formal conclusions but the Presidency, in representing the European Union in the various forums where the problem of Iraq has been discussed, has stuck to the text which was agreed at the end of that meeting, as one on which the Presidency could express a common view.
</p>
<p class="contents">If one had listened to this debate from outside Parliament, one might have the impression that there were huge divisions among European Union states on how to deal with Iraq. One might also have the impression that there are substantial divisions within this Parliament. But it is worth identifying the very large areas of common ground among the European Union states and in this Parliament, as is identified in the joint resolution which will come before Parliament at a later stage in the proceedings.
</p>
<p class="contents">That resolution covers the same ground which has been identified as important common ground by European Union members of the Council, such as the need for international law to be upheld. Otherwise the whole order in the international world comes crumbling down. That is a crucially important objective where we all agree. In that regard, Security Council Resolution 687 has not been adhered to and that is a clear breach of international law. Further, we agree that Saddam Hussein has very many dangerous weapons of a biological and chemical nature and that those dangerous weapons are a danger, not only to neighbouring states in the Middle East and to the international community, but also the people of Iraq. Any settlement must include unconditional and unrestricted access for the representatives of the United Nations through UNSCOM. And, importantly, every effort must be made to try to seek a diplomatic solution to the problems we face.
</p>
<p class="contents">That is a very large area of common ground that will be shared not only by the European Union members of the Council and the Members of this Parliament but will be seen outside by the peoples of Europe as a very important, reasonable position in trying to face up to the dangers in Iraq.
</p>
<p class="contents">I want to conclude by mentioning the other important common position, namely that we all recognize the crucially important role that Kofi Annan will play on behalf of us all in taking the backing of the Security Council to Baghdad to identify all those common positions and to say to Saddam Hussein that we want to negotiate a diplomatic solution. Nobody wants war but if a solution is to be achieved, there has to be movement by the Iraqi government to guarantee those important points which I have identified and which I know are included in the backing Kofi Annan has from the Security Council. I hope by the time the General Affairs Council meets next Monday we are able to see that real progress has been made. We will then be able to understand how important those common positions were in achieving what I hope will be a settlement.

<p class="contents">In relation to the last question raised by the Member opposite – why now? – the answer to that is because it is now seven years since the commitment was given by Saddam Hussein in 1991 that he would honour the terms of the UN resolution that concluded the military activity. UNSCOM have been trying to do their work. They have been obstructed. There is all this evidence that I referred to in my opening address, and other evidence, that there is a great danger that those large stockpiles of very serious weapons could ignite a problem. Therefore, action has to be taken. I hope that a diplomatic solution can be found to it.
</p>
<p class="contents">In relation to the point raised by Mr Kerr, the Foreign Secretary – in his British capacity – made a statement to the House of Commons ruling out any use of nuclear weapons in the context that was raised. I would have thought that Mr Kerr might have been aware of that.
</p>
<p class="contents">Regarding Mr Oostlander's very valid point, it would have been preferable to have had a text after the Panama meeting but because of the nature of the informal Council, it was not possible to have a binding text. That will be possible from Monday's GAC. I hope that the basis, which was understood and recognized at Panama can form some of the substance of what might be agreed on Monday. Events are moving very quickly. On Monday, many of us will be concentrating our minds on Kofi Annan's mission and how that has resulted.
</p>
<p class="contents">Regarding the question by Mr Wolf on which specific points arising out of Panama have been raised by the British Presidency at the United Nations, the answer is that all of the points which were covered are part of the British position in the United Nations. As I said in my winding up, I believe that we have honoured our obligations under the Maastricht Treaty in that regard.

. </span>‐ Ladies and gentlemen, I would like to have your full attention. As you know, this morning we have a sitting and vote which is rather difficult to manage in that, as announced, we must break at midday precisely to welcome the President of the Republic of Portugal and then resume afterwards. It is all the more difficult since, as you are aware, we have a number of highly sensitive votes.
</p>
<p class="contents">So, in order to organize the situation as well as possible, I would like to take up the proposal again which I made this morning and which has been amended very timely by the considerations which some Members have forwarded to me.
</p>
<p class="contents">So, for this morning and this morning only, I repeat while we are waiting, we should reorganize things – I am sure everyone is aware that this is necessary and, furthermore, the suggestion made by a colleague this morning that the group chairmen and the members of the Bureau meet to review the whole situation is an excellent one. So before we reorganize things, I propose that this morning only, following the votes – I hope you are all listening – that those among you who believe in their heart and conscience that they do not need to participate in some of the votes should indicate this quite simply in the course of the day to the Clerk"s Office.
</p>
<p class="contents">This would allow us to vote in a dignified way on this morning"s very important reports. It goes without saying of course that if Members prefer to indicate their intention at each roll‐call vote, they have every right to do so and I will respect this right. So again, the aim of my proposal is to allow us to work as effectively as possible this morning.

(PSE).</span> – Madam President, I can understand your desire to speed up the agenda, but my problem is that if we accept what you are proposing then it will be a set precedent for the future. I do think that the Bureau, in its wisdom, after hearing this confession this morning would wish to reconsider these matters. We would like an assurance that this would be for this session only and that we would have the right to return to the Bureau's previous guidelines. Secondly, we would like an assurance that the Bureau will not wait three months to review these matters but will review them within the next three days. That would be another assurance which I think would go a long way to pacify this House and allow us to proceed.

The proposal which I made to you, whilst I am aware that it is not perfect – although no system is perfect – applies only to this morning, and also, taking into account the exceptional situation this morning, requires us to interrupt our votes for half an hour for the reasons everyone is aware of.

You can remind Members who feel that they cannot vote in favour of or against a particular proposal that we do have in fact a third button on our voting machine that they can press, namely the abstention button.

rapporteur. – (DE)</span> Madam President, you will not have expected otherwise than for me at this point to make the sharpest possible protest, not against you, dear Madame President, but against our President, because I regard this procedure as absolutely unacceptable. I shall explain why. I quote paragraph 2© of Rule 72: “ An amendment’, and that is what we are talking about here, ’shall be admissible if it seeks to amend a part of the text of a common position which was not included in – of differs in content from – the proposal submitted in first reading and which does not amount to a substantial change within the meaning of Rule 62.’
</p>
<p class="contents">Allow me to refer to the fact that firstly, we are in fact at the second reading of the Framework Directive, but that there has never actually been a first reading, because at the time no framework directive was even on the table, That is the first thing. Secondly, if we had at the time introduced amendments to the implementing directive on spices, containing the stipulation that the irradiation should be analytically provable or that we would have to have standardized methods, then everybody would have been justified in thinking we were stupid. And they would all have said – I was also the rapporteur at the time, of course – that that Blottnitz woman had gone crazy, for at that time, eight and a half years ago – and many still think so today – these methods did not even exist. Consequently, we cannot demand them. It is absolutely necessary that we demand them today; it is a Framework Directive. We cannot allow irradiation to take place without then stipulating analytical test methods. Why do we need a label if we cannot check whether there has been irradiation or not?
</p>
<p class="contents">This is extremely important. For spices it is not important, but it is important for the positive list which will be established after the Framework Directive is drawn up, and which will then apply. It can never again be rectified, whether they protest now or not. It is a question...

chairman of the Committee on the Environment, Public Health and Consumer Protection.</span> – Madam President, I must say that one cannot but admire Mrs Bloch von Blottnitz's tenacity. Without going into the substance of the matter, the problem lies in Rules 72 and 62. The relevant part of Rule 62 states: ’where, through the passage of time or changes in circumstances, the nature of the problem with which the proposal is concerned substantially changes’, then we take a particular course of action.
</p>
<p class="contents">It was my judgement in committee that the nature of the problem had not changed between the first reading and now: we still have problems with radiation, we know what these problems potentially are, and we need a directive in order to control this. So the nature of the problem did not change.
</p>
<p class="contents">Then we come to Rule 72, which concerns amendments to the Council's common position. We are not allowed to take amendments that did not receive majorities at first reading unless these are new items that are raised by the Council in reaching its common position. It was my view in committee that, sad though it might have been for Mrs Bloch von Blottnitz, the amendments she was seeking to table did not receive a majority at first reading, were not reintroduced, were not introduced freshly by the Council, were not relating to changed circumstances or changed problems since the beginning and, therefore, they were inadmissible.
</p>
<p class="contents">Mr President, I wish to draw the House's and your attention to one of the most wonderful sentences in the Rules of Procedure. The very end of Rule 72(2) states: ’The President's discretion to declare an amendment admissible or inadmissible cannot be questioned.’ I commend that sentence to the House and to you.

</p>
<p class="contents">Both the Commission's and the Council's decisions on limit values for the sulphur content of petrol and diesel are a long way from what is possible and desirable. It is therefore with disappointment that we note that Parliament's rapporteur, Mrs Hautala, has felt obliged to compromise with the values proposed by the Council. We would have preferred Parliament to stick to the decisions made at first reading.
</p>
<p class="contents">In addition, we think that the very strict proposals on aromatics, which are unchanged in spite of the compromise on sulphur content, are very misleading. We consider the limit values for sulphur to be much more important and fear that Parliament's decision gives the wrong signal to the oil industry. This is not the right priority when considering the question of health and the environment.

However, I am inclined to distance myself from certain clauses which I consider to be a little maximalist, despite the fact that I consider the protection of the environment to be very important. And so I do not agree with the examples given by the rapporteur since the cost borne by industry would be much too great compared with the environmental benefit gained. I am convinced that there are other solutions.
</p>
<p class="contents">So what we must do is keep the proposals made by the Auto‐Oil programme, as they set out a restrictive framework for the short term. What is most important is to implement them.
</p>
<p class="contents">We must take into account the impact of these measures on the oil industry, which, although likely to adapt to the initial requirements, could run into difficulties if Parliament toughened the provisions of the programme. It is not a question, as far as I am concerned, of accepting the use of employment as blackmail, but only of confirming a desire to preserve industrial competitiveness in a sector which experiences fierce global competition.
</p>
<p class="contents">I believe we must take into account three factors: cost, effectiveness and competitiveness, and it would be best to apply these within a fixed time frame. Furthermore, we must not lose sight of the fact that the result depends greatly on the number of cars on Europe"s roads, and that if extra expenditure is to be made, the priority would be to increase the proportion of newer cars on the road.

in writing. – (FR)</span> On the request of the European Parliament and the Council, the Commission adopted the Auto‐Oil programme to improve air quality by reducing pollution from road traffic in the years to come. With this in mind, the Commission presented two directives which aim to reduce car emissions and to improve the quality of fuels.
</p>
<p class="contents">At first reading, the European Parliament adopted a large number of amendments which aim to strengthen the standards proposed by the Commission. The Council retained some of these but did not go so far as to go back to the restrictive clauses demanded by the European Parliament for 2005.
</p>
<p class="contents">At the moment we are at second reading and trying to work out an agreement on the common position of the Council. The Committee on the Environment, which thinks that the Council"s progress is still not sufficient, has repeated almost all of the amendments adopted at first reading by the European Parliament.
</p>
<p class="contents">I am in favour of strengthening the measures to reduce pollution and improve air quality, but I think that some of the amendments by the Committee on the Environment do not sufficiently take into account economic and social factors. The application of these amendments runs the risk of having a high cost and bringing with it job losses.
</p>
<p class="contents">In my opinion, the Council"s common position represents a fair balance between the need for better protection of the environment and safeguarding jobs; measures which are overly restrictive and expensive risk compromising this. I also propose that measures are taken to speed up the replacement of the oldest cars and to increase research, notably on engine design, engine improvement and maintenance and the use of new fuels.

</p>
<p class="contents">At second reading, the rapporteur has also been forced to modify a number of the requirements, particularly under pressure from the conservative party groups in the European Parliament, in order to be able to achieve the required majority in the House. Therefore, the proposal is not absolutely ideal from our point of view, but it is still quite acceptable.

The assessments these companies have carried out are clearly overvalued. All the studies and ministers concerned considerably reduce the inferred costs.

The Commission is putting on the brakes while Parliament wants to press on towards more long‐term sustainable environmental requirements for petrol and diesel fuels. The same situation also applies to industry. When requirements have been tightened for reduced emissions and additives, such as lead in petrol, these have quickly been met by the petrol and oil industry.
</p>
<p class="contents">The Commission's proposal is not sufficiently far‐reaching and needs to be strengthened. We need better quality standards for fuels, tough requirements for urban traffic and different tax rates which encourage the use of electric cars and new, environmentally friendly fuels like ethanol. As Mr Lange's report stated, the limit values and times must be obligatory for the year 2000 and 2005, and exceptions should be very strict.
</p>
<p class="contents">Requirements for limit values should be as tough as possible. For sulphur it should be 30 mg/kg for both petrol and diesel.

</p>
<p class="contents">For these reasons I have voted, like most of my colleagues, in favour of strengthening the standards set for fuels, thus allowing the development of biofuels, on the condition, of course, that the European Union accepts that the Member States can adapt their indirect taxation in order to promote cleaner energy.

Putting vehicles into service which meet the new technical standards will only have staggered effects in the medium term, and means the progressive renewal of all vehicles on the road in the Member States of the European Union.
</p>
<p class="contents">However, the use of fuels which meet standards which are more respectful of the environment will have an immediate effect.
</p>
<p class="contents">In this light, a real reduction in the levels of sulphur and aromatic compounds – notably benzene – allowed in relation to the levels currently recorded must come top of the research list. The introduction of oxygen from fossils or plants should also be encouraged, given its positive and immediate effect on air quality.
</p>
<p class="contents">As a source of renewable energy, biofuels or oxygenated compounds from plants – ester from vegetable oil incorporated in diesel oil, or ethanol derivative incorporated in petrol – can provide a suitable response to the problems of pollution immediately, particularly in sensitive urban areas, whilst limiting the greenhouse effect whose effects were highlighted at the Kyoto conference in December 1997.

<p class="contents">Finally, the agricultural sector can benefit from this important channel of diversification by producing renewable raw materials for the production of biofuels, and this could contribute to preserving an important use for rural areas. The production of renewable raw materials should be considered as an economically viable activity for agriculture and can contribute to changing the negative image some people may have of agricultural activities in terms of respect for the environment. The development of biofuels will respond to the needs of the cities, whilst also favouring the expansion of agriculture which is more respectful of the environment.

</span>My reason for voting against the Hautala report is not because I do not agree with the objectives it seeks to achieve, but because I consider that its proposals are untenable.
</p>
<p class="contents">While an improvement certainly must be made in environmental quality and its effects on public health, this must be made compatible with time frames which can be achieved on a technical level, and which can never be less than 3 to 4 years for the execution of works. Moreover, thought must be given to the disparities in investment associated with the use of the various types of crude. Southern Europe uses a “hard’ crude which involves much more expensive refining processes and considerably higher investments than the “soft’ crude used by the rest of Europe. This means that the southern countries, which are poorer, would be obliged to assume at least 60 % of the total investments.
</p>
<p class="contents">In the specific case of Portugal, we have an oil company which is one of the largest in the country, in terms of turnover, number of employees, value added and exports. In addition, this company – PETROGAL – uses the most modern and sophisticated production processes, and will have no difficulty in meeting, by the year 2003, the requirements stipulated in the agreement reached with the Council after first reading. Finally, it should be emphasized that this company is one of the largest employers in most Portuguese‐speaking countries, and its activities constitute an essential component of their respective economies, a fact the European Union must recognize.

(NI).</span> – Madam President, it is essential to have tough targets for reductions in car emission limits. Rapid and real progress must be made to protect the environment. Whilst the modern car is 40 times cleaner than its equivalent in the 1980s, air quality will be greatly enhanced by the implementation of the proposals before the House. Improvements to car standards and cleaner fuels are a necessity.
</p>
<p class="contents">Along with my two colleagues from Northern Ireland, I recently brought a representative of a company in Northern Ireland to meet Commission officials about a new product which can significantly reduce emission levels now, with the additional benefit of reducing overall fuel consumption. This shows the concern in Northern Ireland to ensure action is taken on this issue as quickly as possible. I welcome the initiative of those in my constituency who are proactively working on developing a product to meet the necessary stringent demands of European legislation.

</span>The report by Mr Lange is interesting from more than one point of view.
</p>
<p class="contents">This report will really shed light on the technical progress of the European car industry, especially in the area of engine output. These developments have undeniably had an impact on the reduction of harmful emissions, both for diesel and internal combustion engines. Our desire to legislate in this area is legitimate. However, we should be careful to avoid the pitfall of wanting to do too much.
</p>
<p class="contents">As regards air quality and emissions from new vehicles, most of our work is done. There is the risk of eventually heading towards a reduction in air quality by wishing to impose standards for emissions which are too severe. An increase in these standards would lead to a rise in the costs borne by the consumer. This, in turn, would decrease the chances of the renewal of cars on the roads today, which are already too old throughout the world. This additional ageing would have a negative impact on the environment and would oppose the fixed objectives which we all agree on. So when we have set new standards, we must reach them before proposing more.
</p>
<p class="contents">We must also devise a financial plan of action to increase the proportion of younger cars on the roads throughout Europe: this would benefit both employment and the environment.

in writing. – (DE)</span> These two reports set out the European Parliament"s view of the Auto‐Oil programme drawn up by industry and the Commission. The point of this programme is to determine the best possible fuel mixture together with secondary technical measures in the manufacture and maintenance of car engines in order to maintain clear air.
</p>
<p class="contents">In the EU at this time, there are about 200 million cars of all different varieties. They represent an enormous burden on the environment, now as well as in the future, and they reveal the great economic concerns which have arisen with the vehicles.
</p>
<p class="contents">There has therefore been intensive lobbying activity relating to Mr Lange"s reports, particularly by the car industry and the fuel producers. In my opinion, these reports represent no acceptable compromise between environmental policy and economic interests.
</p>
<p class="contents">Mr Lange rightly emphasizes the need for coherent exhaust gas legislation, Euro−3, with the deadline of 2000 for the first stage, A, and 2005 for the second stage, B. Industry is said to be complaining about the excessively high costs of conversion to new higher values; not included in these are of course the entire economic costs and the harmful emissions which are bad for the health of the people.
</p>
<p class="contents">I am also convinced that high environmental standards present technical and economic challenges to industry. Since 8 % of the overall motor vehicle fleet is renewed every year it is of course going to take years before the innovations to engines and exhaust systems take full effect: hence the necessity for an immediate improvement in fuel quality which has a direct effect on the whole stock of motor vehicles.
</p>
<p class="contents">As for the specific problems of the on board diagnostic systems, there is a concern that such systems could be used by the vehicle manufacturers to restrict, by means of secret codes, the maintenance and repair of cars to those who have access to these codes. This would seriously restrict the maintenance and repair market, which have called, for instance, service organizations like those of the Luxembourg Automobile Club into action. Here too the European Parliament wants standardized and free access to the OBD systems, which I fully support.

Here the Commission represents the old world which supports the vehicle and oil industries, while Parliament is making environmental and sustainable demands of the companies and industrial products of the future.
</p>
<p class="contents">Earlier requirements on industry, such as in the introduction of catalytic converters, clearly showed that if the requirements are clear, industry adapts to the reality and converts its production to meet the requirements. That is also going to be the case for emission requirements for new vehicles. It is therefore very important that the requirements are clearly given in figures and years. In this case, demands for binding legislation are justified. Financial means of control, such as tax concessions to support the production of vehicles with low emissions, are positive, and controls and monitoring in the Member States are necessary for the regulations to have their desired effect. This is one of the areas of environmental policy in which EU decisions could have a major impact.

</p>
<p class="contents">In Parliament there is a broad consensus, representative of the views of the public, that damage to the environment caused by vehicle emissions must be severely reduced. The motor industry themselves accept that there must be improvement and it is a welcome sign that their arguments have moved on to the detail of time scales for reducing pollution.
</p>
<p class="contents">The Union should be as proactive as possible in encouraging the development of means by which pollution by emissions can be reduced. One way of doing this would be to make the Commission more user‐friendly towards organizations and individuals who feel that they can contribute to the battle against pollution. I have recently been involved in assisting a Northern Ireland organization, which is trying to develop a European market for an emission‐reducing additive, in finding its way around the maze of Commission bureaucracy. The additive is widely used elsewhere and has recently been positively assessed by experts at Queen's University, Belfast. We are well aware that the Commission cannot approve or endorse any individual products but I believe that means should be sought whereby it can be made easier for those working in this field to have their products assessed with a minimum of bureaucracy.

We must go further than the Council"s common position and demand mandatory, not indicative limits for emissions in 2005. This is what will improve air quality.
</p>

<span class="italic">
in writing. – (FR)</span> I am in favour of the two reports by Mrs Hautala and Mr Lange as they represent a coherent and ambitious response to the problem of car pollution.
</p>
<p class="contents">It is a matter of great urgency that we combat the greenhouse effect and atmospheric pollution in our towns. It affects our planet and the health and quality of life of millions of Europeans. Our developed societies must put into use all their scientific and technological know‐how and make available the necessary financial means in the name of this cause.
</p>
<p class="contents">At first reading, Parliament rightly indicated its intention to toughen standards by the year 2000, both for petrol and for exhaust gas emissions, along with its commitment to establishing a restrictive framework for 2005.
</p>
<p class="contents">This position of our House enabled the Council to improve the Commission"s initial text. But the technical situation and social and environmental urgency enable us to go further; it is up the European Parliament to go one step further within the framework of codecision.
</p>
<p class="contents">As all too often is the case, a certain number of voices were raised in the name of defending employment and competitiveness against standards going as far as possible. But in this case, these arguments have no foundation.
</p>
<p class="contents">Looking first at the car industry, which is of great importance for employment and our economies, technological innovation is imperative and it also represents an opportunity. Moreover, we must pay tribute to the efforts and the results which have been achieved for some time now by the manufacturers. They know that environmental quality will be a decisive stake, as much in terms of world competition as in terms of the expectations of buyers.
</p>
<p class="contents">The car industry in Europe is faced with the relative saturation of the European market. So it needs the rate of renewal of the cars on the road to accelerate. But this can only really be justified by a significant technological change of course towards cleaner and safer cars.
</p>
<p class="contents">The demanding and restrictive standards for new vehicles proposed for 2005 in the Lange report provide a definite form for this movement and allow research measures to be implemented straight away – essential developments given full knowledge of the facts. The clarity of the framework and of the objectives acts as a guarantee for manufacturers.
</p>
<p class="contents">European institutions must give greater attention to the pollution caused by the number of old cars on the road. So in this sense, a meaningful improvement in petrol quality is an important point, and the proposals in the report by Mrs Hautala alone would bring about a reduction of over 20 % in car pollution. Improvements in petrol affect both new and old vehicles.
</p>
<p class="contents">But I believe that the European Union should also look into the support which the Member States could provide to help get rid of old vehicles on the road which are severe pollutants. Owners of these dilapidated vehicles often only have a modest income, so it is essential to find effective solutions which do not penalize them, such as a scrap subsidy. I would genuinely like to see the European Parliament committing itself to promoting this type of proposal.
</p>
<p class="contents">During the conciliation which could take place following the vote, we should also closely examine the two questions of the durability of the standards imposed and monitoring in use, taking into account the prospect of an accelerated renewal of cars. The new procedures we have retained will also help create jobs in sectors such as chemistry, catalysis, etcetera. This phenomenon has already been observed with the introduction of standards for lead‐free petrol and the catalytic converter.
</p>
<p class="contents">I am in favour of the Lange report.

in writing. – (DE)</span> With increasing numbers of cars in Europe and increasing air pollution, the reduction of exhaust gases is quite definitely in the interest of consumers. Both reports seek to address two aspects of this complex problem: fuel quality and the reduction of exhaust gases.
</p>
<p class="contents">The improvement of fuel is rejected by the oil industry on the grounds of cost. Against this it must be said that a few years ago the industry resisted the catalytic converter, but these are to be found in all new cars.
</p>
<p class="contents">The reduction of exhaust gases, however, is also significantly influenced by the technological equipment in the vehicles. In this, the on board diagnostic systems (OBD) will play an important role by checking the exhaust emissions and drawing the owner"s attention to defects.
</p>
<p class="contents">It cannot be sufficient to buy years of freedom from environmental worries by purchasing a new car with a catalytic converter. The OBD systems will require greater discipline on the part of the consumer, who must keep his vehicle constantly in tiptop condition. If the OBD discovers a defect in the exhaust system, the fault must be removed.
</p>
<p class="contents">As a countermove the marketing of this technological progress must be so regulated that no hidden monopolies can be created which harm the consumer. We must prevent the encoding of diagnostic systems precluding independent workshops from carrying out maintenance and repairs. In addition, these systems must permit the incorporation of parts which are not made by the car manufacturer but which meet their quality standards.
</p>
<p class="contents">This will guarantee that the consumer will have the choice of having his vehicle maintained at a favourable price and to a high standard in the interests of the environment.

<span class="italic">
in writing. – (FR)</span> Atmospheric pollution has become a political issue quite simply because cities and the large European metropolises have experienced or are currently experiencing this type of problem. Now the most visible enemy and the one which everyone points the finger at immediately is, of course, the car, forgetting in that instant factory fumes, aeroplane discharges and so on. I do not want to deny the problem – it is a real one – and Mr Lange and Mrs Hautala were right to take a firm line regarding the car and oil industries, both at first and second reading.
</p>
<p class="contents">Car manufacturers and oil magnates were quick to draw our attention to the effects which these decisions could have on employment. But they must also understand that in responding to the expectations of public opinion on pollution, they will benefit from a better image and this could lead to them gaining new sectors of the market. This is why we will defend the emission limits proposed by Mr Lange. This is why we will also support the standards proposed by Mrs Hautala.
</p>
<p class="contents">Taking the example of diesel, it is clear that its commercial success in certain countries in the Union condemns it to reducing its pollution levels simply in order to preserve its image and its sales. For example, the injection technique ought to resolve this type of problem. It has also been proven that diesel oil has an important role to play in reducing exhaust emissions from diesel engines.
</p>
<p class="contents">Car manufacturers who were not much in favour at the start have decided to make considerable efforts to respect emission standards. It is true that there is still some disagreement particularly concerning durability: it is unrealistic, even irresponsible, to raise the durability of vehicles from 80 000 to 160 000 km, and I would like to make clear my formal opposition to this. This represents a much too stringent requirement on top of the implementation of the necessary limits and will generate additional costs. Other contentious points include on board diagnostics and service monitoring. I think it may be possible to resolve this type of issue in the Conciliation Committee.
</p>
<p class="contents">I am aware that oil magnates are very unhappy with last week"s unanimous vote from the Committee on the Environment last week. Clearly this sector is suffering from an overcapacity for refining and the ageing of its production equipment. But this difficult situation is not at all due to environmental standards. I have to say that the use of employment as blackmail has not succeeded, simply because Parliamentary representatives, just like public opinion, are highly mobilized.
</p>
<p class="contents">We must not wave the red rag on this issue, but should first inform opinion about the consequences of the measures we are recommending would have, and especially on the following subject: in people"s minds for some time now as well as in the press, even diesel causes pollution which causes asthma or causes cancer. This was true of old diesel, but, with these new measures, diesel will be less polluting than lead‐free petrol, thus turning the whole situation on its head.
</p>
<p class="contents">Lastly, and I will end here, the key point which Parliament must deal with is the issue of increasing the proportion of newer cars on our roads. This is the most effective way of greatly reducing the degree of pollution in Europe. Estimates indicate that 20 % of the cars on the road cause around 80 % of the pollution. Any measure aimed at speeding up the process of renewal would have an immediate effect.
</p>
<p class="contents">What we must do is think of both the original measures and of new ones which have not been one of the long line of errors made in France. It is not a question of dressing up a way to facilitate the purchase of a new car, but a way of replacing an old one, all of which would be financed at national and European level. This will be the subject of future discussions.

</span>In my opinion, the European Parliament, which always tends to go further than the other European institutions, is going too far this time with the measures aiming to reduce road traffic pollution.
</p>
<p class="contents">In their reports, both Mr Lange and Mrs Hautala call for more restrictive clauses for the protection of the environment. But my difficulty is when Parliament"s Committee on the Environment goes further, much further than the common position of the Council.
</p>
<p class="contents">Of course I, too, am convinced that the critical thing for Europe is to find a balance between the various proposals for cleaning up the air and their real impact on the environment, and with this in mind, I have to say that the European oil industry has done a great deal to improve air quality up to now.
</p>
<p class="contents">But we must recognize that in order to reach the fixed objectives for cleaning up the air, the European Parliament"s Committee on the Environment is proposing standards which are certainly amongst the most ambitious in the world. But if we consider the costs of the different proposals, ECU 11.5 billion for the Commission, ECU 20 billion for the Council and ECU 60 billion for the European Parliament, I think that in the current state of affairs, it would be unreasonable to go beyond the measures in the Council"s common position.
</p>
<p class="contents">I agree on supporting the Commission"s second Auto‐Oil programme, which must serve as a basis for establishing limits for fuel emissions for the year 2000. However, I think that car drivers in most European countries already do enough via the high rates of taxation on using their vehicles, and we must stop once and for all increasing taxes or constantly inventing claimed new ecological costs for cars.

<p class="contents">It is not easy for the Members of this House to adopt a position. The situation we see is complex and not reassuring. All our cities, both large and small, are full of traffic jams. On some days, certain European cities exceed all the health safety limits. On the other hand, fuel quality is essential for engine performance and to reduce vehicle emissions.
</p>
<p class="contents">In Parliament we have always defended the view that economic development and the protection of the environment are not two opposing objectives, but are complementary. However, the automobile and refinery sectors seem to do little to help achieve these objectives.
</p>
<p class="contents">We must demand the greatest possible technical effort in order to protect the health of our citizens. Otherwise, there will be a blatant clash of citizens" interests.
</p>
<p class="contents">Faced with this situation, the governments have reached a difficult common position, showing that changes are not easy at the moment, as Mr Lange has confirmed. The European Parliament does not have many alternatives left. All we can do is hope that the Council is on the right track on this occasion and that it will look on this common position as a temporary stage on the way towards stricter measures.

(DE)</span> Madam President, I must say that today we have done a great disservice to the cause of consumer protection. It is really incredible what has happened in this House.
</p>
<p class="contents">I would just like to read something which a section of the House has rejected. Afterwards, I do not know how we will be able to take part in an honest election campaign in which we keep saying: Europe is working on behalf of consumers. I would just like to tell you what has been deleted. The treatment of goods with ionizing rays, we have said, must meet completely the requirements of human health. Their use must be absolutely safe in terms of health and may not act as a replacement for health and hygiene measures or for good manufacturing or agricultural methods. That is surely the minimum and the most logical requirement. We have not even stated in the document that there must be no loss of nutritional value or loss of vitamins. It is already bad enough that this happens. But we have demanded the simplest solution and it was not accepted. Nor has it been accepted that analytical control procedures must be carried out.
</p>
<p class="contents">I wonder, why are we bothering to insist on compulsory marking? This is utterly monstrous; what are we supposed to tell our people. It is not even true to say that the Standing Committee on Food meets in public; it meets far more undemocratically behind closed doors. I ask you: what are they up to? We always say that we want the best, and most of all we want to protect health. We spend huge amounts of money on better health provision and then we make mistakes concerning the most basic matters!
</p>
<p class="contents">For a start, legalistic nitpicking drives normal motions into secondary importance, in other words, they become inadmissible, and this then leads to the most logical proposals being rejected. So I really do not understand the world. I cannot tell you how embarrassing that is or how we are going to go into a public election campaign. They will all keep saying: Europe makes everything worse, it makes our food worse, etcetera. I must admit, when I see something like this, I unfortunately have to agree!

(DE)</span> Madam President, although I am of the opinion that the irradiation of food is to be avoided in principle, I have made up my mind to vote for the Bloch von Bottnitz" report, so that in the Single Market there can be better information, better monitoring and thus better protection of the health of consumers. I am extremely sorry that not all colleagues have followed this path and that the required majority has not been achieved. I am afraid that we have thereby done a great disservice to the consumers of Europe.

in writing. – (DE)</span> I am in favour of the very restrictive conclusions of this report, which will allow the irradiation of foods exclusively as a method of preservation for spices.
</p>
<p class="contents">In Luxembourg, the irradiation of food with the aim of preservation is actually forbidden. In only three countries – Belgium, the Netherlands and France – may irradiated foods be sold.
</p>
<p class="contents">Whereas the EP, since it was first concerned with this problem, that is, since 1987, has been determined to gradually ban completely the irradiation of foods, the Commission has tried to regulate jointly this kind of preservation. A compromise has thus become an opening to more foods being allowed for irradiation.
</p>
<p class="contents">For the present common position, the European Parliament"s Committee on the Environment, Public Health and Consumer Protection has drawn the abovementioned conclusions, which are similar to the Swedish position in the Council; consequently, food other than spices cannot, in principle, be irradiated.
</p>
<p class="contents">I share this view, which I already put forward in this House in October 1989 and in December 1993.
</p>
<p class="contents">I am deeply concerned about the plan contained in the common position of the Council and the Commission to issue both a framework directive and an implementing directive containing a positive list which is gradually being extended – it currently includes only the aforementioned aromatic herbs and spices. In this way, under the guise of regulating something positively, we are simultaneously allowing for the possibility of extending radiation to as many foods as possible. The excuse that no regulation is worse than a minimum regulation is unacceptable, for the regulation we have before us will gradually lead all the EU countries to tolerate irradiated foods on their markets.

It is appropriate that it is stressed that irradiation cannot be used as a substitute for good, hygienic handling of products, but irradiation of foodstuffs in general cannot be accepted.

in writing. – (DA)</span> To start with, I am against treating foods and food ingredients with ionizing radiation. So it is good that Parliament's requirements for approval are so stringent that the positive list will be limited to spices and roots where no other method of preservation is available. We must ensure that fresh foods are preferred and so restrict irradiation to the absolute minimum. Because the European Parliament takes the same sceptical approach to ionising radiation, I am in favour of Parliament being given the authority to assess any extension of the positive list of foods which may be irradiated. It should also be possible for individual Member States to impose tighter rules.
</p>
<p class="contents">I cannot support the Committee on the Environment's amendment to approve an analytical method of control only. There are a number of different methods available and it is essential that the method used depends on what is to be examined. On the other hand, it would be beneficial to limit as far as possible the number of different methods of irradiation. This would make controls easier.
</p>
<p class="contents">Finally, I would like to emphasize that the marking of the foods irradiated must be transparent. If we cannot ban irradiation completely, we can at least ensure consumers have a proper opportunity of selecting these products.

<span class="bold">
</span>First of all, I would congratulate the President of the European Parliament for his responsible attitude in refusing to incorporate at second reading new amendments to the proposal for a Council directive, as provided for in our Rules of Procedure. Some Members who wished to burden the legislative process and administrative restrictions have tried in vain to cloud the issue and to penalize ionization technology by creating a great deal of fuss.
</p>
<p class="contents">Now it is important that this debate on ionization of foodstuffs takes place with transparency and with serenity. We must take care not to put up with ambiguity in this process whose aim is not to improve the initial quality of agricultural products, but rather a conservation technique like others which enables perishable foods to be preserved. Its advantages are that it makes foodstuffs more reliable, enables them to be used more widely and makes harvests aimed for human consumption last longer. This process destroys pathogenic micro‐organisms, eliminates insects and parasites, prevents the germination of bulbs and tubers and increases the life of fruits.
</p>
<p class="contents">The World Heath Organization, the International Atomic Energy Agency and the FAO are therefore encouraging the development of this technique. However, a number of Members in our House do not seem to be familiar with the scientific analyses which the judgement of these international organizations is based upon, and they tend to deal with the issue of ionization of foodstuffs at an emotional level, even though the political decisions must be made using reliable scientific data.
</p>
<p class="contents">The Commission is proposing to set up a specific independent committee which it will be able to rely on when proposing to the Council amendments to the current directive on the ionization of foodstuffs.
</p>
<p class="contents">Personally, I believe that this procedure is adequate and provides all the necessary guarantees, on condition of course that the committee is genuinely independent. We have suffered enough from the problem of BSE not to be particularly attentive to these critical issues in connection with any malfunctioning of the Commission. I recall that on the issue of mad‐cow disease, the Commission did not take the necessary measures because it did not wish to take them, and it did not see to it that the ad hoc scientific committees were functioning properly.
</p>
<p class="contents">As a result, the procedure proposed, which gives the Council the final decision, seems entirely satisfactory, because the governments of the different Member States are best placed to protect their own consumers.
</p>
<p class="contents">The adoption procedure for the current directive has been exceptionally long – eight years have elapsed between first and second reading – and this shows that the Council wished to adopt a cautious approach. So it was particularly inopportune to use this second reading to slow down the administrative and legislative process still further.
</p>
<p class="contents">Some Members wanted to include the entire application procedure, incorporating the list of products which could be ionized within the text of the directive. In this way, the European Parliament itself would have had to reach a decision on this list in the name of codecision. But is this not simply confusing different roles and an attempt by Parliament to increase its powers by seeking to take the place of scientists? This was a dangerous direction to take. The Members do not have enough scientific knowledge to authorize or modify the standards and technological procedures. We can therefore be glad that the proposal to create a specific independent committee was approved by the majority of our House; this means that those with political responsibility will be able to take decisions on the future of the important issue of ionization of foodstuffs based on the argued opinion of scientists.</p>

in writing. – (FR)</span> The environment has gradually taken on an increasing importance in the construction of the European Union.
</p>
<p class="contents">Regulation (EEC) 1210/90, which is to be amended through this report, had allowed us, in this respect, to comply with the initiative taken in 1989 by Jacques Delors to create a European Environment Agency.
</p>
<p class="contents">Today"s report must present us with the opportunity to debate what lies at the root of all changes in European legislation on the environment, that is, the collection and distribution of objective and accurate information gathered in all the countries of the Union.
</p>
<p class="contents">Established in 1995, the EEA has until now undertaken valuable work concerning the environmental situation in the countries of the Union in terms of the collection and distribution of objective data and perfecting techniques to aid forecasting and prevention.
</p>
<p class="contents">I am therefore taking the opportunity that this report has presented to congratulate the Agency on its progress in fulfilling its duties. The Agency has notably drawn up reports on problems such as climate change and taxes on the environment, and has established several networks to collect and distribute information in this field. But the Agency cannot work alone!
</p>
<p class="contents">As the rapporteur points out, the Agency has still changes to make and it must move towards greater cooperation with all of the Community institutions, in particular the European Parliament. This would improve the transparency of information among the different countries of the Union, thereby showing the Agency to be a true instrument in helping to make political decisions in this area.
</p>
<p class="contents">Moreover, in future, the Commission should systematically ask the Agency for reports before implementing even minor new Community policies.
</p>
<p class="contents">In this sense, I agree with my colleague, Mr Collins, who, wondering why there is no mention in the Commission"s report of the importance of Parliament"s role in the legislative process, asks that the obligation to report its results to Parliament be included in the draft revision.
</p>
<p class="contents">The European Environment Agency must also, within the framework of its duties, take into account other aspects such as forests, waste products and chemical products on the one hand, and on the other, the Union"s future time scales, particularly its enlargement and the environmental problems that this will undoubtedly entail.
</p>
<p class="contents">Finally, I would like to highlight the fact that while some people are discussing the dismantling of environmental standards or clauses on the planet under the draft Multilateral Agreement on Investment (MAI), to the benefit of multinational companies, I, on the contrary, am defending the enhancement of environmental cooperation with third countries.

</p>
<p class="contents">The Commission is nonetheless proposing to extend the scope of the Agency's activities with a view to establishing a European Environment Information Centre. It is also important that greater cooperation is achieved between the Agency and Member States and of course applicant states.
</p>
<p class="contents">I would hope that there will be a positive response to the rapporteur's proposal for a closer working relationship between the Agency and the Commission and also for the establishment of a data register by the Agency which would include legislation and information to improve the enforcement of EU environmental policy including a cost/benefit analysis.
</p>
<p class="contents">Finally it is important that the Agency's multi‐annual work programme should be complemented by a multi‐annual budget in order to enable the Agency to plan its work more effectively.

(PPE). </span>‐ 
<span class="italic">
(NL)</span> Mr President, with increasing frequency the European Union is acting in a divided manner towards the outside world in crucial foreign policy issues. This is unfortunate. We saw it in the Iraq affair which was discussed at length here this morning, and we are seeing it again in a number of human rights issues. Again, this is unfortunate.
</p>
<p class="contents">Last year, during the annual meeting of the UN Commission on Human Rights we saw a terrible display of 15 EU nations towards China. Whilst the Netherlands as President rightly tried to get European support for a critical stance, four EU countries pulled out. It was a sad spectacle of disagreement and Europe was exposed.
</p>
<p class="contents">This is why we are making an urgent plea to the United Kingdom to be very active during the coming weeks, so that the ranks of EU Member States will be united in Geneva in March, and so that serious violations of human rights will not be sacrificed to the golden calf of economic interests. We wish to draw particular attention to two countries, Nigeria and Burma.
</p>
<p class="contents">On the subject of Nigeria, the elected President has been overthrown and put into prison during a military coup. It was followed by massive intimidations and a great deal of violence during which the supporters of Abiola, relevant politicians, soldiers, officials and other citizens were tried in often secret tribunals and killed, or treated so badly in prison that they died subsequently. We all know the story of Ken Saro‐Wiwa, and we also know that Adua died in similar circumstances. Now there is another general standing in front of a secret tribunal, and we all know how that will end. Meanwhile, the rulers get rich at the expense of the ordinary people, and the number of people living in absolute poverty in Nigeria has increased from 35 to 44 million. 50 million people are illiterate, and 70 million are without drinking water. The average life expectancy has fallen from 54 to 47.
</p>
<p class="contents">Mr President, we believe that Nigeria needs a firm approach, and in spite of all earlier statements we are asking that we should steer towards an economic boycott. This is the wish of our group – and we are no radical left wingers – and is the wish of a large section of this Parliament.
</p>
<p class="contents">As regards Burma, Mr President, there, too, a President who was elected by 80 % of the population was removed by military force. There, the opposition was also imprisoned and killed. There, parts of the population are also terrorized and – worse still – sections of minorities are used for slave labour.
</p>
<p class="contents">Mr President, the United States have introduced an investment ban. Dutch companies, such as Heineken, have also withdrawn, but we are seeing, to our annoyance, that other firms, such as Total, are establishing themselves in Nigeria to fill a gap in the market. Here, too, we are asking for tough action, and as far as we are concerned for an economic boycott, and most definitely an investment ban.
</p>
<p class="contents">Mr President, I would like to conclude by saying that we believe that the European Union should speak with one voice on human rights issues. We believe that the Presidency should do its utmost to get the Member States into one line. We also believe that those countries that do not wish to cooperate should be seriously called to account on this. We do not wish to see a repeat of last year in the next session in Geneva, and we hope that the British Presidency will manage to see to it there is one line, and to see to it that there is tough action, especially as far as the two countries mentioned earlier are concerned.

(IT)</span> Mr President, ladies and gentlemen, the European Union has far too often been accused, not entirely wrongly, of being strong with the weak and weak with the strong, in other words, of energetically pointing out the violations of human rights in countries of little geopolitical significance and of closing its eyes to the violations of the stronger countries. This is certainly not the case with Nigeria.
</p>
<p class="contents">This is a great regional power with economic and military strength; and so, if possible, it has greater responsibilities towards the other States in the region. We should not forget that Nigeria is constantly seeking to assert its political weight on the other countries in the region, and on the developing countries in general, to oppose the constant appeals of the international Community to restore democracy, an independent legal system, the lawful state and respect for human rights.
</p>
<p class="contents">It is therefore impossible to remain silent in view of the arrests of those opposed to the current regime, the most authoritative members of the civilian society of that country, nor can we tolerate lightheartedly the fact that several international oil companies are still working in the Ogoni region, despite the violations of human rights and environmental pollution.
</p>
<p class="contents">As I said this morning, politics, particularly international politics, abhors a vacuum. The European Union and its individual states cannot fail to exert strong pressure on the Abacha regime to make it perform a serious about‐turn, not hesitating, in the extreme, to deprive the current military junta of its principal financial means, by applying a total embargo on the oil trade of that country. Faced with extreme situations, such as that of Nigeria, we can only use extreme measures.

(ARE).</span> – Mr President, I would like to echo the points made by colleagues and it is good to see the House uniting. Mrs Maij‐Weggen said that her group was not radical, my group is called the Radical group and naturally we associate ourselves with radical policies. I think what is important is that we have compromised to produce a joint resolution which I hope the House will pass overwhelmingly. I also agree totally with the remarks made by my colleague Mr Fassa.
</p>
<p class="contents">We have to remember sometimes just how big the prize of Nigeria is or how big the challenge. This is the giant of Africa, the country with one hundred million people which dominates the continent. As my colleague Mr Fassa has just said if we ignore the giants and pick on the pygmies then people will conclude that the European Union is not serious about its foreign policy. We have all been exercised about the problems of Iraq and the dictatorship there, but it would be a lot easier to bring about the overthrow of the Abacha dictatorship than that of Saddam Hussein.
</p>
<p class="contents">Sanni Abacha overthrew the elected government. He rules with a ring of steel around him but he is not supported by the people of Nigeria. They are looking to us for a lead to see in what ways the European Union is prepared to put democracy first and its own economic short‐term interests second. In the long term, I think we have an interest in a free, democratic Nigeria with which we can trade as a full member of the ACP Lomé Convention.
</p>
<p class="contents">In the meantime, we have set out in this resolution a series of practical steps which the European Union could take and I hope that the Council of Ministers will respond to this and see whether they will go along with each of these. This is a very carefully calibrated practical series of proposals from this Parliament and I think that they are a very fitting response to the challenge. But at the end of the day the final sanction which has got to be contemplated, and this Parliament has already supported it in the past, is an oil embargo. That is the one thing which Nigeria above all fears. It is the one thing which could bring down the regime so we have to keep that up our sleeve as the last resort and in the meantime put the pressure on the regime to transfer to democratic government which is what the Nigerian people deserve.

</p>

<span class="italic">
(EN)</span> Many condemnations of the Nigerian regime have been issued within this House and within the Commonwealth, notably since the day of November 1995 when Ogoni activists were hanged despite repeated calls from the international community for the sentence not to be carried out.</span></p>
<p class="contents">In the aftermath of this dramatic event, sanctions were adopted by the Union and have been regularly extended since then. No less than 11 resolutions have been adopted by this House since 1993, when the democratic process in Nigeria was brutally interrupted by the cancellation of the presidential elections and the establishment of a military regime under General Abacha. We are of the opinion that diplomatic pressure on the military rulers must be increased and that a clear signal must be sent to them. The Union and the international community should take them at their word.
</p>
<p class="contents">General Abacha gave an undertaking to transfer his powers to a democratically‐elected civilian president by the end of this year. Let us take him at his word and, as the present resolution rightly states, we must clearly set out a number of prerequisites that we consider essential to guarantee the credibility and the viability of the promised transition to civilian government.
</p>
<p class="contents">The European Union must make every effort to bring the Nigerian leaders to fulfil these preconditions for a smooth electoral process and to convince them that it is the very credibility of the transition process which is at stake. In this context, we think the Union must act in close cooperation with the Organization of African Unity so that a concerted effort is made to convince Nigeria's leaders of the need for a spirit of genuine openness towards democracy. If this is achieved, then the European Union and the international community will have to draw the appropriate conclusions.

(PSE).</span> – Mr President, Burma and Nigeria are obviously, geographically, thousands of miles apart. However, the people in those two countries both endure the most tyrannical military juntas and suffer systematic abuses of human rights.
</p>
<p class="contents">Unfortunately, as others have said, Europe's response is often perceived as being guided too much by our own commercial advantage, rather than the need to respond to the misery of the people in those countries where we risk undermining the very credibility of any claim that Europe is, in fact, genuinely committed to human rights. Democracy and good governance and our commitments to those two issues are also called into question by people in Burma and Nigeria who say that fine words will not, in themselves, assist their struggles.
</p>
<p class="contents">Should we not respond to the calls that have been made repeatedly by Aung San Suu Kyi for political and economic isolation of the SPDC. Is it not time other Member States followed the initiative undertaken by Britain, that has at least outlawed trade promotion in Burma?
</p>
<p class="contents">Would the President‐in‐Office of the Council please give me some information as to whether it has made any progress on this matter? Also, will he report to me whether the European Union is doing anything about the large numbers of Burmese people who are being forcibly repatriated into Burma, from Thailand, as a result of the financial crisis?
</p>
<p class="contents">Similarly, on Nigeria, will the Council give us a commitment that it will implement the measures already agreed in the common position, particularly on visas, which have been regularly flouted by generals? The sports boycott has been flouted due to pressure from the French government to allow the Nigerian football team to take part in the World Cup in June. That is an extremely regrettable initiative.
</p>
<p class="contents">The President‐in‐Office will be aware that at the Commonwealth Conference the foreign ministers agreed that if the promised return to civilian rule in Nigeria was not credible, then a mandatory oil embargo, a ban on airlines, an arms embargo and a freezing of financial assets would take place. Will the President‐in‐Office confirm that the Council will take similar actions at such time? Will he spell out the terms and the timetable on which the proposed transition would be acceptable, including the unimpeded registration of genuine political parties, the release of Chief Abiola and other detainees and international monitoring of elections?
</p>
<p class="contents">Would the President‐in‐Office agree with me that if the Council were to set these clear benchmarks, which we have laid out in our resolution, then we would avoid risking acquiescence in the process which Abacha is so clearly engaged in and that will result in a civilian glove covering the military fist that Abacha has applied for so long?

(IT)</span> Mr President, we asked for this debate with the Commission and the Council on topics of major importance concerning the specific principle the Community institutions and the EU countries should adopt in the presence of countries which are very seriously violating the most fundamental human and democratic rights of their citizens.
</p>
<p class="contents">The case of Burma is certainly today one of the most serious in the world. The “list’ of problems is, unfortunately, sadly known and runs from generalized political and social repression to the exploitation of forced and child labour, from drugs trafficking to violation of human rights.
</p>
<p class="contents">This situation is constantly deteriorating and the government is not showing any signs of finally wanting to begin a process of democratization in the country. In the Burmese State"s budget for 1997‐98, defence costs officially amount to 43 % of the total. These resources are used for internal repression and in the interests of the military establishment in power.
</p>
<p class="contents">The Burmese civilian society has shown its desire for democracy on numerous occasions that have always received our firm support, as shown when the Sakharov Prize was awarded to Aung San Suu Kyi several years ago.
</p>
<p class="contents">However, the amount the international Community can do, starting with the EU and its Member States, becomes a deciding factor.
</p>
<p class="contents">For this reason, while supporting the measures already adopted by the Commission and Council, we ask for pressure to be increased on the Burmese government, accentuating its political and economic isolation.
</p>
<p class="contents">It is from within Burma itself that the EU is asked to block any economic relations with the government, ending investments, trade and tourism and taking restrictive measures on entry visas, as well as strictly controlling the embargo on arms sales.
</p>
<p class="contents">The attitude of the large private companies, with numerous direct or indirect interests in Burma, is decisive. A pressure policy should be applied to these companies to freeze their business in the country, business that is only beneficial to the Government.
</p>
<p class="contents">The opinion the citizens of Europe and those of the rest of the world will have on the European structure also depends on the firm and responsible way in which we manage to deal with the Burmese question and the other democratic emergencies throughout the world.

(DE)</span> My questions relate to Burma. We have presented and discussed various resolutions on Burma and we were usually in agreement with the Commission and the Council that we must do everything to push forward the democratization process. This, however, has just not happened. My question is therefore how the British Presidency intends to present a common foreign policy position on Burma and perhaps to get this process in motion.
</p>
<p class="contents">The question relates in particular to how the Presidency intends to deal with adherence to the ILO Convention on slave labour. We know that slave labour prevails in Burma. How can we ensure this directive is successfully implemented?
</p>
<p class="contents">I also have a specific question concerning the oil company Premier Oil, which in September 1997 announced its intention to buy the shares of the US firm Texaco from a natural gas company. Will the British Presidency support that or do you advise them, on the basis of resolutions passed here to desist from doing so?
</p>
<p class="contents">The third point is that, as we have said, whilst the circumstances in Burma remain as they are, we will be against Burma being included here, on the basis of the treaty arrangements between the European Union and the ASEAN countries. This is because, as we of course repeatedly emphasize, human rights must be respected and this is also a condition or a part of the treaties. What will be the attitude of the British Presidency in the continuation of relations between the EU and ASEAN?

(NL)</span> Mr President, as a member of the Committee on Legal Affairs and Citizens" Rights, I must confess I am more familiar with human rights violations of the fundamental rights within the European Union, which, as you know, come under the authority of the Committee on Legal Affairs and Citizens" Rights, rather than human rights violations outside the European Union, about which my colleagues know a lot more than I do. But as I know the region quite well, including Burma, I was suddenly asked to speak. I have tried to catch up on human rights violations outside the European Union, because situations in my own country prompt me to a certain degree of modesty in this respect. If you consider that the Netherlands had been denounced by the Court of Human Rights in Strasbourg for not having an independent judiciary, for not having a perfectly organized defence system and for not having properly functioning freedom of speech, then I say that I am quite willing to consider human rights as a problem, but rather as a “we problem’ than a “you problem’. This is my first point.
</p>
<p class="contents">When Burma joined ASEAN, I immediately paid a visit to Rangoon for strictly personal reasons, and used the opportunity to lay a wreath at the British war cemetery for those who died on the railroad during the Japanese occupation. I was very impressed with how civilized the people in that country were – and I can fully see why the British considered it as one of its most advanced colonies, when it was still a colonial power. I therefore went back over Christmas, and I also visited the Anglican Church – and I can recommended this to my British colleagues – where the war chapel has a handwritten record of all the British people who gave their lives for the freedom of this country, and for my own church, the Anglican Church. And I am now delivering to you a plea from the bishops of the Anglican and Lutheran Church, regarding the fact that all economic measures affect first and foremost the poor members of the population. That is the message I wanted to pass on.

<p class="contents">It has to be said, and this struck me yesterday during my intensive research of human rights violations, that we apply a kind of selection process – and I must ask my expert colleagues about this –, because a country like Brunei, which has no parliament at all, one of the nine ASEAN members, has never been on our hit list.
</p>
<p class="contents">I have one last comment, Mr President, and that is that religious beliefs, which do exist, as I experienced in Burma, are always judged harshly by this Parliament. These are my last words; maybe we can pay some attention to this from within Christian circles.

<span class="italic">
(NL)</span> Mr President, Mrs Maij‐Weggen already made the point at the beginning of the debate that the UN Commission on Human Rights, which took place when the Dutch held the Presidency last year, was a black page in the Union"s human rights history. Unfortunately, international attention was focused on how extremely divided we were; this division was chiefly based on economic advantage.
</p>
<p class="contents">The Council promised better, and why not in fact? The Union, acting jointly at UN level in this area, might achieve something. This applies especially to larger countries, and in this respect, I would like to mention China. The balance between open and silent diplomacy is right, but what will the result bring? I do not think we should be obsessed with China. We must also remember Nigeria, Burma, Cambodia, Sudan, Afghanistan, Algeria, and perhaps Cuba, because the Pope does not sanctify everything.
</p>
<p class="contents">UN resolutions should be followed up to the letter. My question to the Council is: does he think he might achieve a better system for monitoring UN resolutions and for strengthening the follow‐up structure? This year the opportunity to reinforce the UN position must be seized, since it was fifty years ago in Lake Success that the United Nations was founded.
</p>
<p class="contents">Any attempts to not take the United Nations resolutions seriously will obviously achieve the opposite. How does the President‐inOffice of the Council think he might give the decisive push for the realization of a powerful UN declaration on the protection of human rights defenders? After all these years there should at last be a powerful agreement on this. Defenders of human rights deserve a declaration as an appreciation of all their work, and the Member States are morally committed to that in this important year for the UN. I hope that this Presidency will interpret that in the right way in any case.

(SV)</span> Mr President, as the chairman of the delegation for relations with China, I am the first to admit that it is not easy to know how to influence this huge country. We often discuss that within the delegation. We are even going to have a special seminar about it.
</p>
<p class="contents">It is clear that we should not break off relations. And it is clear that we should continue to strengthen our contacts and continue with dialogue. But should we really stop criticizing China completely? That seems to be the Council's view, since it is now going to dispense entirely with proposing a resolution in Geneva.
</p>
<p class="contents">It is true that things have happened in China. It is true that certain laws have been changed. It is true that a convention on social rights has been adopted, or at least signed. It is true that Mary Robinson has been invited there and it is true that the Sakharov prize winner Wei Jingsheng has been released. But is that really enough to give China approval? Human Rights Watch does not think so. Nor does Wei Jingsheng, whom I had the occasion to meet in Brussels a while ago. They think that 
<span class="italic">
pressure</span> should be maintained too.
</p>
<p class="contents">I would like to ask this: is it really the case that the Council has a strategy for human rights in China? Or is it just commercial considerations that have led to this new passive approach?

(FR)</span> Mr President, this Parliament resolution is important. I have the same doubts as Mr Gahrton as regards the Council"s desire to adopt a position which I hope will be Parliament"s position tomorrow. There are certain precedents, particularly that of the past year. I also have some doubts as regards the Commission. There are some issues concerning China which are quite worrying. Some projects have been blocked for two years and I have just learned that, following a restructuring of the services of the Commission, the projects which DG VIII had examined and organized were transferred to DG 1B. This will force us to restart the whole process and lose more precious months. Some projects have been blocked for two years. The Council may have reservations, but so too has the Commission.
</p>
<p class="contents">There is one point as regards the United Nations resolution on which I absolutely do not agree: that of “Algeria’. This morning, Parliament succeeded in adopting a dignified stance on Iraq although this is not the case for other institutions. Thanks to the subcommittee chaired by Mr Soulier, in Algeria"s case, Parliament is moving in the right direction towards adopting a dignified position, so it will not contradict itself by adopting a paragraph which demands that an international committee of inquiry be set up on Algeria tomorrow. It was a huge job to get Parliament to move on this; I hope and I am fairly convinced that we have succeeded. Now we must try to influence the Council and the Commission. Parliament will not go back on its word by calling for an international conference; that would be absurd.

(UPE). </span>‐ 
<span class="italic">
(NL)</span> Mr President, sadly, I could fill the minutes allocated to me listing countries which flagrantly violate human rights, but I will mention a few which are not often highlighted.
</p>
<p class="contents">Firstly, I would like to mention Angola. The government rules over the largest part of the country now and, sadly, murders of the opposition leaders are increasing, including in the Cabinda region. The international community is doing nothing, tempted by oil and the generous sale of arms to the country.
</p>
<p class="contents">Secondly, I would like to take the case of Cuba. Seven prisoners have been released, who incidently were forced to leave the country immediately, but that still leaves 500 political prisoners. Because of the internal split in this Parliament, we rarely discuss this. No Cuban dissident has ever been important enough to this Parliament to receive the Sakharov Prize. This is incredible and selective, Mr President.
</p>
<p class="contents">Apart from looking critically at this Parliament, I also want to look critically at the Council. How has the Council put into effect the human rights resolutions which were accepted in the UN last year? What has been done to promote and guarantee the work of the special rapporteurs? How is the Council going to organize a strong and cohesive EU position for the coming 54th Session of the UN? Is the Council prepared to give clear signals during the Session to countries like China, Mexico, Nigeria, Syria and Cuba, countries which are totally obstructive during the negotiation and decision‐making process? Will the Council not let itself be influenced by China"s one step forward, two steps back policy? Does the Council really see the exclusion of Burma at the coming ASEM summit as a useful contribution to compliance of human rights?
</p>
<p class="contents">To conclude, for over a year some resolutions in this Parliament and some political factions have been calling for an oil boycott in Nigeria. Is the Council truly prepared and does it intend to raise this with the Security Council? Because otherwise we are sitting here producing hot air, and that is not what this Parliament is here for.

<span class="italic">
(PT)</span> Mr President, the promotion of human rights rightly represents a central aspect of the European Union"s foreign policy and the Amsterdam Treaty proclaims the defence of human rights to be the ethical and legal foundation of all Union action.
</p>
<p class="contents">That is why the oral question now before us is important. The objective is to ensure that Parliament can exert its influence in a manner that enables the Council to adopt common positions which will strengthen the values of our European identity and protect the autonomy of the Union, on the occasion of the 54th Session of the United Nations Commission for Human Rights. As you will remember, during the last meeting of that Commission, the European Union was not able to adopt common positions, on such important issues as China, which was reflected in an inadmissible loss of autonomy vis‐à‐vis the United States. This placed some Member States in the difficult position of having to individually defend the principles of the entire European Union, while others forsook these principles in the interests of immediate economic interests.
</p>
<p class="contents">During this year in which we commemorate the 50th anniversary of the Universal Declaration of Human Rights, we should act in harmony in order to render the mechanism of the United Nations itself effective in ensuring that human rights are respected throughout the world. In compliance with the principles of universality, indivisibility and interdependence of human rights, we request that particular attention be paid to the situations in China, Nigeria, Burma, Sudan, Iran, Iraq, Afghanistan, Cambodia and East Timor. In addition, the serious and cruel situation in Algeria is particularly topical, and particularly complex in the sense that it is not the sole responsibility of one state, except in so far as that state is unable to guarantee public order and respect for the fundamental rights that are being jeopardized by fundamentalist terrorists.
</p>
<p class="contents">No apparent improvement has been noticed in China, which is another priority, despite the country"s declaration that it intends to ratify the United Nations international human rights covenants. I think we should attribute due importance to this fact.
</p>
<p class="contents">We request the submission of written reports to Parliament by the Council and the Commission on the dialogue that has recently been reopened on the subject of human rights. In addition, we all consider the situation in East Timor to be a priority, with the continued illegal occupation and repression exercised by Indonesia. We urge the Council to pursue its own common position and follow up on the countless resolutions passed by Parliament.
</p>
<p class="contents">Our resolution contains a series of requests, in particular, as regards the approval of the statement on ombudsmen, who should be granted additional powers in order to implement the resolution on the abolition of the death penalty. We also request that steps be taken against the ill‐treatment of prisoners, that treatment of refugees should be improved and that standards for the protection of children and against the traffic in women should be raised.
</p>
<p class="contents">Therefore, we ask that the CFSP be implemented to take action on this crucial issue. In this respect, the European Union should avoid double standards and must defend human rights in an effective manner as a foundation for its positive contribution to international politics.
</p>
<p class="contents">Mr President, if I may trespass further on your patience, I would like to draw attention to the presence in this House of our former fellow Member, Mr van Outrive, who worked so hard with us in matters relating to human rights and to whom, with his permission, I would like to extend a special greeting here.

<span class="italic">
President‐in‐Office of the Council</span>. – Mr President, I should like to begin by thanking the honourable Members for their questions and their interventions. I am pleased to address the questions they submitted. I would like to deal with this in three parts plus an addendum. The first part will deal with Nigeria, the second with Burma, the third with human rights and I will then make an announcement in relation to Azerbaijan on human rights.
</p>
<p class="contents">Firstly, on Nigeria, the Council has been following the situation in Nigeria with concern since the annulment of 12 June 1993 presidential elections. It has had measures in place against the Nigerian regime since then as a mark of its concerns about the lack of respect for human rights and democratic rule. This concern intensified throughout 1995 which saw the trial and harsh sentencing of 43 alleged coup plotters, including former Head of State General Obasanjo and a number of other high‐profile civilians, Abacha's announcement of a three‐year transition to civilian rule and finally the execution of Ken Saro‐Wiwa and his eight co‐defendants after a flawed judicial process.
</p>
<p class="contents">The two common positions adopted on 20 November 1995 and 4 December 1995 strengthened the European Union measures to include, among others, visa restrictions on members of the Nigerian regime and their families, including those in possession of long‐term visas, a full scale arms embargo and a sports ban. As the honourable Members have noted, on 28 November 1997 the Council of the European Union extended the common position on Nigeria of 4 December 1995 until 1 November 1998.
</p>
<p class="contents">At the same time the Council reiterated its concern about the abuse of human rights in Nigeria, including the detention of political prisoners as well as the slow pace of democratization. It also underlined its willingness to support the transition process. Since then the Council has followed with considerable concern developments in Nigeria, including the tragic death of Shehu Yar'Adua in detention, the further arrest and detention without charge of journalists and pro‐democracy activists, plus the arrest on 21 December 1997 of General Diya and a number of others in connection with an alleged coup attempt.
</p>
<p class="contents">On 26 December 1997, the Luxembourg Presidency issued a declaration on behalf of the European Union appealing urgently to the Nigerian authorities to treat those arrested in accordance with the legal principles corresponding to international standards. This declaration also made clear that the European Union could not accept a repetition of the events of 1995. The Council has noted that a seven‐man military tribunal has been constituted under the chairmanship of Major General Malu to try 26 people held under suspicion of coup plotting. On 14 February the press were allowed to witness the inauguration and see the accused but we understand that the proceedings will be held 
<span class="italic">
in camera</span>.
</p>
<p class="contents">The European Union successfully co‐sponsored further critical resolutions on Nigeria at the 1997 sessions of the United Nations Commission for Human Rights and the United Nations General Assembly. The UNCHR resolution led to the appointment on 16 October of a special rapporteur on Nigeria with a mandate to make contact with the Nigerian authorities and people and report on the human rights situation in that country. His first report will be submitted to this year's Commission. We will be pressing for a further tough resolution based on his report.
</p>
<p class="contents">I want now to move to Burma. I applaud the sustained interest which Members of the European Parliament continue to take in the appalling human rights situation in Burma. The Council strongly shares Members' concerns. Its working groups at all levels regularly discuss ways in which to promote change in that country. The Council's message on Burma is simple. The people of Burma have expressed democratically their wish for a fairer deal and their voice must be heard by their government. To reinforce that message and encourage reform, the European Union has introduced a package of tough measures against the Burmese regime.
</p>
<p class="contents">The common position on Burma first adopted in October 1996 includes a full‐scale arms embargo, a ban on the issuing of visas for members of the regime and their families, a ban on defence links and aid except for humanitarian aid and a ban on high‐level official visits. The European Union has also suspended preferential trading terms for Burmese exports to the Union of agricultural and industrial goods. Some Member States have introduced additional measures on a national basis.
</p>
<p class="contents">The Council regularly reviews whether there is a consensus for them to be adopted by all Member States. There is no question of any relaxation of these measures without a substantial improvement in the human rights situation in Burma. We are conscious that in some circumstances such sanctions can hurt the very people they are designed to help. To help relieve the suffering which Burmese government policies cause to ordinary Burmese people, the European Union partners are considering a package of positive measures to strengthen civil society in Burma and to reinforce the excellent humanitarian work which is already being done there.
</p>
<p class="contents">I want to pay tribute to the many European and other non‐governmental organizations which work tirelessly to improve conditions on the ground. The Council is working with non‐governmental organizations to tackle the problem of Burma's refugees from both sides of the border. European Union ambassadors in Bangkok are in touch with the government of Thailand about the need to provide shelter and protection for refugees. We continue to monitor the situation closely and stand ready to take swift further action if necessary. We also work to promote improvements in Burma through close coordination of policy with our international partners. The Council keeps Burma high on its agenda for intergovernmental discussions. We firmly believe that governments in Asia have a particularly important role to play in using their influence with the regime to press for reform in Burma and we continue to urge them to do so.
</p>
<p class="contents">Our international partners cooperate closely in the UN. For example, the United Nations General Assembly in December adopted by consensus a tough resolution on human rights in Burma. Several European Union Member States were co‐sponsors, and the text is stronger than last year's resolution in key areas. We look to the Burmese authorities to respect their obligations, as a UN member, and implement the resolution immediately. The Union will also introduce a resolution on Burma at the United Nations Commission on Human Rights in Geneva next month.
</p>
<p class="contents">The Council has taken concrete measures to address human rights abuses in Burma. It is keeping the situation under very regular review and stands ready to consider further measures, positive or negative, as the situation on the ground demands.
</p>
<p class="contents">I should like to move on more generally to human rights. From mid‐March to the end of April the Presidency will lead the European Union at the 54th session of the UN Commission of Human Rights in Geneva. Those rights are an issue for the whole year, not just for the annual sessions of the Commission. But the Commission is certainly the most important single opportunity in the international calendar to demonstrate our commitment to human rights and to work towards a realization around the world. We are conscious though that the Commission is not always an easy environment: many different viewpoints are represented. There will be those present who will seek to hamstring the work of the international community to promote human rights. Many countries automatically oppose intrusive mechanisms and the realization by their citizens of their inalienable rights. We will do our utmost, with other like‐minded countries, to ensure that such disruptive and indefensible opposition does not prevail.
</p>
<p class="contents">A major focus of this year's Commission will be the 50th anniversary of the Universal Declaration of Human Rights. The Declaration established universal standards of human rights. Fifty years on, the standards remain as relevant as they were when the Declaration was adopted. But we remain a long way from their full realization. The 50th anniversary is a time for implementation of those standards. It is not a time to unpick existing texts, and we will resist firmly any attempts to do so.
</p>
<p class="contents">We will pay particular attention at the Commission to ensuring that it takes effective action to promote the rights of children. So often children's rights are forgotten or ignored. Children's rights must be a cross‐cutting element in all the work of the Commission. There is near‐universal ratification of the Convention of the Rights of the Child, and the time has come for implementation.
</p>
<p class="contents">Another key cross‐cutting issue for the Council is the human rights of women. We will ensure that women's rights are given their due place in the work of the Commission, not just in the resolutions which specifically cover women's rights, but in other Commission action.
</p>
<p class="contents">The EU will play a full role across all the work of the Commission. In particular there is already agreement within the Union that the Presidency, on behalf of the Union, will table resolutions on Nigeria, Burma, the Democratic Republic of Congo, Israeli settlements, Iran, East Timor and Iraq. We will also take the initiative on Colombia, where the welcome decision to set up a human rights office in Bogota stems from Union action. The Union will, in addition, make an intervention setting out our position on other countries where we have major human rights concerns.
</p>
<p class="contents">The Council is still considering how to address other countries' situations at the Commission, including China. We regret the breakdown of the European Union consensus on a CHR resolution in 1997. We are still considering action at the Commission on Human Rights. But it will depend on developments and progress made in the bilateral and European Union human rights dialogues. We expect to make a decision shortly.
</p>
<p class="contents">We have concerns about the human rights situation in China and are seeking to address these in a cooperative way with the Chinese government. China has demonstrated a willingness to discuss human rights with us and the European Union as a whole. China has also entered into a dialogue with others. These discussions have produced results, information on individual cases and agreement on technical cooperation programmes. The Presidency will also make interventions in debates on racism, democracy and development, detention and rule of law issues, women's rights, advisory services, the rights of the child, human rights' defenders, as well as on Israeli settlements.
</p>
<p class="contents">We will support the Commission's various independent mechanisms, including special rapporteurs and working groups. They play a crucial role in monitoring violations and advising governments on human rights improvements.
</p>
<p class="contents">The Council, as you may imagine, does not expect an easy session. But we know what we want to achieve: real progress towards the realization of all human rights for all people, and we will be working hard to make sure that we achieve it.
</p>
<p class="contents">As I indicated at the beginning of my contribution, I can today, as a result of pressure by the Union, announce that Azerbaijan has abolished the death penalty. I believe it is a helpful step forward in promoting human rights, and we call on other countries to follow that example.

Moreover, we have a list of speakers and a series of speakers who have not yet had the opportunity to take the floor, and who have as much right to receive answers from the President of the Council and from Commissioner Marín as those who have already spoken. Therefore, I would ask for your understanding and ask you to present your question to the President‐in‐Office of the Council when the debate has ended, because we still have another ten speakers on our list, and we cannot favour any Member to the detriment of others. I hope you understand that I cannot proceed in any other way.

<span class="italic">
Vice‐President of the Commission. – (ES)</span> Mr President, in general terms the Commission completely accepts the position expressed by the British Presidency with respect to Nigeria and Burma. I just want to explain a few points.
</p>
<p class="contents">It is true that Nigeria is at a critical juncture because presidential elections are due to be held in the next six months, and we hope they will lead to the installation of a civilian government in that country, under a civilian president. So there is a lot at stake. If, for whatever reason, the process of democratic transition were to founder, it could result in a reappearance of the spectre of violence and bloodshed, which could perhaps spread to other countries, with very serious human and economic consequences. We are convinced that the Nigerian people would not peacefully accept another military regime.
</p>
<p class="contents">On the other hand, the many questions which Members have raised about the Nigeria issue show the concern within the European Union to see the democratic process firmly established in that country, and the economic benefits of its resources finally distributed fairly amongst the population, which is increasing all the time and becoming poorer and poorer.
</p>
<p class="contents">As has been said, Nigeria is too big and important a country, both within Africa and globally, to be marginalized.
</p>
<p class="contents">Let me state quite categorically that the Commission will do everything within its power and the limits of its authority, to assist and mobilize the necessary resources to strengthen Nigerian civilian society, and particularly its most vulnerable groups.
</p>
<p class="contents">Twenty‐seven years of successive military governments have left an indelible mark on Nigerian civilian society, which will take a long time to disappear. The apathy and fatalism which characterize a large part of civilian society should be reversed somehow. We are convinced that Nigeria"s well‐known spirit of enterprise and dynamism can be reawakened for this purpose.
</p>
<p class="contents">Finally, I want to say that the Commission intends to continue its efforts towards dialogue with the Nigerian government, giving special priority to measures designed precisely to combat human rights violations, strengthen the independence and training of the courts and the legal professions, improve governability and assist the process of supporting democracy.
</p>
<p class="contents">As for Burma – and this is not the first time we have discussed these matters in Parliament – the Commission wishes to clarify the following points: to the best of our ability, and following the common position adopted by the Council, we have tried to establish what is known as “critical dialogue’ with the military junta. Apart from the ASEAN meetings at the United Nations in New York, our attempt at critical dialogue has not worked and is still not working, for the simple reason that it has been rejected. At the moment there is no significant contact between the Commission and the military junta. It is true that the common position calls on us to initiate that political dialogue but, I repeat, with the military junta this has not been possible.
</p>
<p class="contents">With the democratic movements it is a different matter, and we have set in motion a whole series of decisions. I do not understand how Mr Dupuis can talk about delays. That is not true. The Commission has set in motion a programme of support for the opposition, for the Burmese dissident movement which has been established in Europe, and in that sense we have launched a project with the aim of strengthening the democratic movements and training members of the opposition and future leaders. We have opened a Europe‐Burma office in Brussels. In other words, we 
<span class="italic">
have</span> made contact with the opposition and with the dissidents within that opposition living in Europe, and we are helping them. As for the military junta, I cannot tell them anything, for the simple reason that we have no form of contact with them. The only chance is the forthcoming visit by Kofi Annan"s special envoy, Mr Álvarez Soto, the aim of which is precisely to attempt that critical dialogue, on behalf of Kofi Annan.
</p>
<p class="contents">Finally, the European Union"s position on the ASEAN question is very clear. Firstly, the fact that Burma has been accepted into ASEAN"s regional framework is a matter for ASEAN itself. They accepted that country in the belief that by means of what they call “constructive engagement’ – which turns out to be the English version of the Asian translation of “critical dialogue’ – they would demonstrate that dialogue really has been strengthened. As far as the Commission is concerned, I first want to point out once again in Parliament that Burma is not included in the 1980 cooperation agreement which was extended to Brunei and Vietnam. In any case, the Commission does not intend to propose to the Council that the ASEAN‐EU regional cooperation protocol of 1980 should be extended. In that sense, we are maintaining our position, apart from the fact that it was confirmed in the Council"s common position. Furthermore, Burma is also excluded from all the cooperation programmes being implemented with ASEAN.
</p>
<p class="contents">So there is no need to worry, because as things stand and until such time as the common position changed, we are strictly complying both with what the Council called for in its common position and with what this Parliament has so often called for. That is the latest news I can give you on these two problems.

(PSE).</span> – Mr President, over two years since the execution of Ken Saro‐Wiwa, when his son, Ken, came to Brussels three days later and generated total and absolute support from every part of this House for a return to democracy and human rights in Nigeria, we are forced once again to ask the European Parliament to condemn the Abacha regime's continuing disregard for these principles.
</p>
<p class="contents">Abacha's presidential candidacy from four out of five parties and the continued house arrest of Chief Abiola do not constitute a transition to civilian rule, Commissioner Marín. The arrests of alleged coup plotters last December, threats against journalists who report them, and the arrest of 30 perceived activists preceding the Ogoni Day celebrations last month are all testimony to the abandonment of even token efforts by the Nigerian government towards democratic transition.
</p>
<p class="contents">I ask the Commission and the Council to respond to Mrs Kinnock's points about clear benchmarks for this transition process.
</p>
<p class="contents">We say again, today, that oil sanctions remain the only instrument available to the international community which will guarantee change; oil earnings, which account for 96 % of all Nigeria's export earnings, with 40 % of all federal government revenue provided by one European company: Shell. The European Parliament should condemn the Nigerian government for its announcement this month that it is seeking to resume oil operations in Ogoniland by force. We should join calls on Shell to publicly denounce this.
</p>
<p class="contents">Last year we held discussions with Shell in this House on their business principles. We accept that they have the potential to be a force for good in Nigeria, but they must accept greater responsibility in response to the latest crisis. Batom Mitee, brother of the acting president of the Movement for the Survival of the Ogoni People (Mosop) told 
<span class="italic">
The Times</span>: ’Farmers are struggling for land and space with oil exploration. They do not see the government. They see Shell. They want Shell to show some concern.’ On 3 January this year, Batom"s car was stalked and searched by members of the same internal security force set up to repress anti‐Shell protests. A report about the struggle against Shell was found on the back seat. Batom was dragged out of his car and severely beaten. He was detained and severely tortured, denied food, medical care or access to a lawyer.
</p>
<p class="contents">Ken Saro‐Wiwa believed he would die ‚all for Shell’. Let us, let Shell, let every Member State who trades in oil act now to save the life of Batom Mitee, of the thirty others arrested with him, and of all oppressed Nigerian people who they represent.

(PPE).</span> – Mr President, as one of the co‐authors of the resolutions on Nigeria and Burma, I am particularly pleased that we are having this debate this afternoon using the oral question with debate rather than the normal urgency procedure. I am grateful to the President‐in‐Office and to Mr Marín for their respective statements which I think probably take the matter as far as possible, bearing in mind in particular that the President‐in‐Office has, so to speak, to represent the fourteen other Member States.
</p>
<p class="contents">On Nigeria, he referred to the sports ban. This has to be considered somewhat ironic in view of the fact that Nigeria has been given the go‐ahead to take part in the World Cup. It tears a hole in the whole system and allows a number of Nigerians to come to Paris and other places to take part in the World Cup. I do not know whether he is able to offer an explanation but it is an illustration of how one Member State can drive a cart horse through the whole system.
</p>
<p class="contents">On Burma, the only point I can make in one minute, since I was not able to be present this morning for reasons beyond my control, is the extent to which investment is still going on there. A company like Total, for instance is making substantial investments. We correspond with them and they send an arrogant reply that they will have nothing to do with us and give no information whatsoever. I wish that the President‐in‐Office could ask some very pointed questions of certain Member States and of certain companies. There are a lot of others involved as well. I have made my two points concerning the World Cup and the extent of investment in Burma.

(IT)</span> Mr President, ladies and gentlemen, I listened attentively to what Commissioner Marín had to say, albeit in a cool manner, and attentively because this shows, once again, how Europe is totally powerless on two contrasting issues – Nigeria and Burma.
</p>
<p class="contents">What is happening in Nigeria? The military power of this bloodthirsty junta – for it was called a junta by Commissioner Marín, rather than a dictatorship – with a president who had been elected and of whom we know nothing, with Ken Saro‐Wiwa and other Ogoni representatives who have been executed, is now extending to other African countries. And now we have news that the Nigerian military have invaded Sierra Leone; refugees are already escaping from their land on account of this military intervention, brought forward under the pretext that they, the Nigerians, are the peacemakers in Africa. I have not heard you say anything about this, Mr Commissioner. I would like to know whether, in this critical dialogue the Commission intended to hold with Nigeria, the possibility that Nigeria may become the peacemaker with the arms of Africa and the African region is also implied.
</p>
<p class="contents">The second question relates to Burma. It is true that we cannot allow this country to join the ASEAN, and therefore there is no dialogue between Europe and Burma, but it is also true that there is a creeping legitimization of the Burmese dictatorship, although it has wiped out, tortured, incarcerated and summarily executed the opposition, while putting Nobel Prize winners under house arrests and so on and so forth. We have not had much reassurance on this either, Mr Commissioner, from you or from the Commission.

</p>
<p class="contents">Clearly, I do not agree with Mr Dupuis. I am not at all reassured as regards the fate of the numerous people who have disappeared, nor as regards the practice of torture and the secret detention camps. I call on the Council and the Member States to list Algeria amongst the priorities for debate at the next session of the United Nations Commission on Human Rights and remain convinced that sending a special rapporteur does not represent a punishment or a condemnation of this country. On the contrary, this mechanism, which was provided for by the United Nations and used for countries where the situation is less worrying than in Algeria, will enable us to shed light on the situation and break the deadlock.
</p>
<p class="contents">Algeria is really on the road to democracy – we have noted this before. So it should be able to accept that transparency is brought to those areas which remain opaque, at least for the moment. And it is also up to us to encourage this country to accept the promotion of universal values and respect for individuals.
</p>
<p class="contents">In clarification, the joint resolution does not mention the call for an international committee of inquiry, contrary to what Mr Dupuis says.

(NL)</span> Mr President, Nigeria is a particularly bad apple in a basket of not too sound fruit. Democratically elected presidents are deposed and political opponents imprisoned or hanged. The Nigerian regime is also active outside its own borders. Under the ECOMOG flag, Nigerian soldiers are fighting against the military junta in Sierra Leone, supposedly to reinstate the democratically elected president, but Sierra Leone"s diamond fields must be the primary reason.
</p>
<p class="contents">The question is, what can the EU do against the regime in Nigeria? In November 1995, the Council suspended military cooperation and development aid. In December of that year these measures were strengthened. Now that three years later these measures have had not any effect, some people in this House are arguing for an oil boycott. This would hit the regime hard, because oil exports account for 90 % of its income.
</p>
<p class="contents">However, the experience we have gained with boycotts of this kind shows that it is above all the people who suffer, whilst the regime the boycott is targeted at, is often able to keep its position for years to come. Because of the largely poor majority in Nigeria, I question the use of an oil boycott. That is why I am investigating the feasibility and consequences of an oil embargo. After that, it can be decided whether an embargo of this kind should be imposed. I do believe that the existing sanctions the Council introduced against Nigeria should be closely observed.

(DA)</span> Mr President, the people of Burma deserve a vote in favour of the statement being debated here today. The Burmese regime is one of the most unpleasant dictatorships in the world. The people are being brutally suppressed, and the military dictatorship has not the slightest respect for human rights. Burma is the centre of the Asian narcotics trade: it produces more than 2 000 tonnes of raw opium a year, and another 250 tonnes of heroin, which are exported to the West. The dictatorship uses the income to tighten its grip on power. The proposal we are debating here today demands in very clear terms that foreign companies stop investing in Burma immediately and that the EU introduces economic sanctions against Burma as soon as possible. Aung San Suu Kyi, who was awarded the European Parliament's Sakharov prize, has called on the EU take this action. During the era of apartheid in South Africa, it was again those who spoke for the oppressed who demanded that the rest of the world should put economic pressure on the regime, but business in the West fought against this. Now business is making profits in the country where the anti‐apartheid movement has gone furthest. People must understand that investing in Burma amounts to direct support for the military regime. It would be better for the Burmese if this regime were overthrown and economic sanctions have proved to be more effective in the past than critical dialogue with someone who does not understand the meaning of the words.
</p>
<p class="contents">I heard Mr Marín say that critical dialogue has failed, so I am expecting a statement from the Commission saying that, now that we have totally failed in this area, economic sanctions will be applied. That would suit both the Commission but also, in particular, the Council because I think Mr Henderson's answer on Burma was rather meaningless.

(DE)</span> Mr President, I have a preliminary remark to make. I would like to ask the Bureau to try to arrange even joint debates as thematically as possible, for it is rather complicated to trace a common thread of meaning between Burma, Nigeria and the 54th session of the Human Rights Commission in Geneva. I say this in view of the fact that we have an audience.
</p>
<p class="contents"><span class="italic">
<span class="italic">
(Applause)</span> </span></p>
<p class="contents">But allow me to say something about the 54th session of the UN Human Rights Commission in Geneva. For many people it represents hope, but it also disappoints many people. For us, however, for the European Union – and therefore I would like to underline this very clearly here – it is a test case, to show to what extent the Union is serious about its own human rights policy and how it converts its own theories into practice. Many countries, particularly Denmark, were all the more dismayed when some states of the European Union no longer supported the resolution on China introduced with great difficulty a year before.
</p>
<p class="contents">Of course, no country is prevented from improving the situation of human rights in their own territory. If that is really the case then we shall not be the last to confirm it.
</p>
<p class="contents">This year, too, another proposed resolution is before the European Parliament, which calls on the Council to define joint priorities in Geneva. The list of countries criticized because of their human rights policies is still very long, much too long, in fact, and just a few examples are Algeria, Iraq, Iran, Nigeria and the Democratic Republic of Congo. In addition there are problems such as the international trade in human cargo, namely in women and children.
</p>
<p class="contents">Nevertheless, we are not abandoning hope that the European Union will show a common strong front, for only then can we do anything. This is directed equally at the President of the Council and the representative of the Commission. Given, in particular, the enlargement towards the east of the European Union, we should take these questions very seriously and measure our own attitude against the criteria which we apply to other countries. This applies above all in the year of the 50th anniversary of the Universal Declaration of Human Rights which we want to see extended by an international Court of Human Rights. In my opinion it is an exhortation to ourselves.

(SV)</span> Mr President, ladies and gentlemen, we have so often taken up the question of crimes against human rights perpetrated by the military junta in Burma, but we must return once again to the subject. We are not alone in our criticism. Both the United Nations and the USA along with many other countries have recently made renewed protests in this respect.
</p>
<p class="contents">Aung San Suu Kyi was democratically elected by an overwhelming majority of more than 80 %, but is being prevented from taking over responsibility and is still under house arrest. Many politicians are in prison for political reasons and are being denied their democratic rights. Political meetings are banned and there are continued attacks on ethnic minorities. Among other things, 400 villagers were killed in May and June last year. There is also a strong link between the military regime and drugs producers: most of the world's heroin comes from Burma.
</p>
<p class="contents">On several occasions, Aung San Suu Kyi has asked the international community to introduce political and economic sanctions against Burma, which is something President Clinton decided on in May last year when new investments in Burma were banned. But multinational oil companies, including European ones such as Total, continue to support the military regime. The oil companies' investments account for the largest amount of foreign exchange in the country. Therefore, it is important that Parliament again strongly condemns the dictatorship in Burma and demands that human rights are guaranteed so that Aung San Suu Kyi is released from house arrest and the UN's inspectors can unconditionally carry out their assignment.
</p>
<p class="contents">It is appropriate that the Council has decided not to accept Burma's participation in the meeting between the EU and ASEAN until the human rights situation has improved in Burma. But Parliament now demands that the Council respond to Aung San Suu Kyi's call for economic sanctions against the military junta by breaking off all trading and tourist links between the EU and Burma, and by stopping investment in Burma by European companies.
</p>
<p class="contents">The Council's representative, Mr Henderson, said earlier that the Council was prepared to adopt further measures. What initiatives is the Presidency prepared to take for effective economic sanctions and to promote democracy in Burma?

(PT)</span> Mr President, ladies and gentlemen, here in the European Union we are neither the government of the world, nor the policemen of the world. At this particular moment in time, this government and policing falls to another union. But, within our bounds, the European Union and, more particularly, the European Parliament have contributed a great deal to the policy of defending human rights. However, this policy has not been coordinated in such a way as to represent a consensus of the parties of the European Union during the United Nations debates on this subject. Often, a chorus of small voices carries less weight than a single, stronger voice. This is not the example that has been given by the European Union.
</p>
<p class="contents">Moreover, the United Nations resolutions are frequently flouted, which often detracts from the credibility of its decisions. This attitude is exemplified by the current situation in Iraq and Portugal"s own historical case of East Timor. I could cite dozens more, but you are better acquainted with this subject than I am.
</p>
<p class="contents">I consider that the European Union has the right and, indeed, the duty to work actively to enhance the prestige of the United Nations, by drawing attention to these facts. The questions submitted by some of my colleagues to the Council and to the Commission have that positive end in view.

(DE)</span> Mr President, ladies and gentlemen, Commissioner, what effect do European Parliament debates on human rights actually have? Do they just make people aware of problems and then disappear into archives or do they emphatically pursue attempted solutions far beyond the shores of Europe? Do they prosecute regard for human rights, do they contribute to the elimination of deplorable situations, do they offer any encouragement at all to those forces whose humanitarian, ecological or economical work needs to be supported? The abuses of human rights in Burma continue unabated. There is illtreatment, imprisonment, enforced labour and slave trading. The woman who won the democratic elections over 9 years ago, winner of the Nobel Peace Prize, Madame Sun Kyi, is still 
<span class="italic">
de facto</span> under house arrest.
</p>
<p class="contents">Burma is today probably the biggest producer of opium in the world and is miles away from cooperating with other countries in the fight against drugs. I can therefore only repeat the demand I made in my speech of March last year: cancel the tariff preferences for Burma. Even if this measure is financially very small it must be extended for the fourth time. But it will not be enough on its own. The European Union is and remains a Community of values. The maintenance of democracy and human rights is one of our highest principles. We are not a movable object which allows itself to be misused for tactical ruses. Anyone who gets involved in the battle against the abuse of human rights is in no way subject to the law of non‐intervention in so‐called internal affairs. We must use economic pressure to exert political pressure on the revolutionary government. We must impose more far‐reaching sanctions. Like the Americans, the Europeans must get companies to stop investing in Burma. This gives rise to three questions to the European Commission.
</p>
<p class="contents">Commissioner Marín, firstly, what chance do you give such an embargo on investment? Secondly, in your view, are firms in Europe ready to take such measures? Thirdly, what possibility do you see of preventing European firms from filling the vacuum caused by the withdrawal of American firms?

The result is that European companies are beginning to take over the contracts the Americans are leaving behind. Where American companies are withdrawing, European ones are entering. What is the minister going to do, together with his colleagues in the European Council of Ministers, to stop this, and to come into line with America on the Burmese issue?

(DE)</span> Mr President, I must repeat a part of my question because the Council has not answered it. I had asked whether the British oil company, Premier Oil, announced in September 1997 its intention to buy shares in a natural gas firm in Yetagun from the US firm Texaco after the latter decided to pull out of Burma. Now of course we have again universally confirmed our condemnation of the regime. What is the attitude of the British Presidency of the Council – this was my question before – to this possible purchase? We really would like an answer on this issue. Equally – this is a supplementary question to the Commission –, on the issue of the compulsory return of refugees from Thailand to Burma, is humanitarian aid continuing there, guaranteed by the EU?

<span class="italic">
President‐in‐Office of the Council.</span> – I should like to make a procedural point. I was told that Parliament would like me to answer the written questions and that there was an opportunity for debate on those matters. I answered the written questions but then, supplementary questions were raised by the original questioners. I was given no notice that I would be required to answer them. I am not complaining about it, but I suggest I take the questions as we do in Question Time and answer them like that, as I do not propose to give any written answers in future, for the rest of the Presidency.
</p>
<p class="contents">I do not want to bind future presidencies to this procedure, but I am not going to do both. I am either going to answer the questions as they are asked or I am going to answer the written questions because what I am being asked to do is to go over the same ground again. I am happy to do it today, but I will not be doing it again in the future – with your support, Mr President. I would like to do one or the other. It is an extension of Question Time. If Parliament wants Question Time to be longer and have less time for debate, that is fine with me. But we really have to smarten up the procedure.
</p>
<p class="contents">I shall now take the various issues which have been raised, and there are quite a large number of them. I will try and link them where I can.
</p>
<p class="contents">Firstly, as regards the sports ban on Nigeria, an exception has been made for Nigeria in the World Cup because the French government had a prior arrangement with FIFA which contractually bound them. They supported a sports ban on the basis that the prior agreement with FIFA would continue to be upheld. That was agreed by the Council.
</p>
<p class="contents">The next question put on Nigeria by Mrs André‐Léonard was: would Nigeria be top of the human rights agenda? The answer to that is that it should be, and I hope it will be. We will endeavour to put it at the top of the agenda in discussions in Geneva later this year.
</p>
<p class="contents">On the question from Mrs Lenz on enlargement, the Copenhagen criteria make it quite clear that meeting democratic targets and meeting human rights commitments are part of the enlargement process. The Treaty of Amsterdam takes the whole question of human rights further in the preamble and reinforces the need for upholding the highest standards of human rights for all EU countries. That is part of the enlargement dialogue. All the countries who wish to accede to the European Union are aware of that procedure. When I visited some of those countries that wish to accede, in preparation for the UK Presidency, I raised those issues with them. If they were not aware of them before, they are certainly aware of them now.
</p>
<p class="contents">On the question of Burma, there is no investment ban. There are a number of policies which are in place. I did, in my initial introduction, refer to the suspension of preferential trading for Burmese agricultural and industrial exports into the European Union. In as much as that is a ban, it is an encouragement to Burma to mend its ways. There are no further bans in place though I can mention, from a UK point of view, that we would certainly be receptive to toughening‐up our approach to Burma. If other colleagues wish to join us in the Council on that, then it could be carried further. Discouraging tourism and stopping trade promotion is a starting‐point here. We would certainly want to push that agenda at the Council and hope to achieve in the future support from our other colleagues.
</p>
<p class="contents">Again, as regards relations with the United States, we would want to cooperate with them so that any initiative which was taken by the European Union would not be undermined by the United States. It is important to have that dialogue.
</p>
<p class="contents">I now move to the question of benchmarks, which was raised by Mrs Kinnock, Mr Macartney and Mr Howitt. That is a very sensible proposal. I can let the House know that the issue will be on the agenda at the next EU‐Nigeria experts meeting, which is being convened by the Commission in March in Brussels. The outcome of that meeting will be a basis for the Council to take decisions in this matter at a later Council meeting.
</p>
<p class="contents">Regarding the question that was asked by Mr Bertens on ASEAN, I do not believe that Burma is attending the ASEAN conference, so the matter does not arise. Mrs Maij‐Weggen raised the question of the US link. I have already covered that point.
</p>
<p class="contents">Regarding the question raised by Mr Telkämper about whether aid will be affected, the answer to that is ‚no’, but I would want to consult officials and then I can give a definitive answer to him in writing later. Indeed the Commission may be able to provide further information on that.</p>

<img align="absmiddle" alt="" src="https://europarl.europa.eu/doceo/data/img/arrow_summary.gif"/>  <span class="doc_subtitle_level1_bis">Marín, </span>
<span class="italic">
Vice‐President of the Commission. – (ES)</span> Mr President, in relation to the explanations which some Members were requesting from the Commission as regards Burma, there is no problem with NGOs. Work is going to continue. I can even tell you that just the day before yesterday we started to consider how to intervene in the problem of the Burmese refugees being expelled from Thailand, because that is a new problem developing in the area. So the absence of critical dialogue with the Burmese military junta is not going to prevent the Commission from continuing to develop its programmes within the country, of course, unless the military junta simply decides to stop them, but that would be a problem of a different nature.
</p>
<p class="contents">On the subject of human rights, I was also asked whether the Commission could study the possibility of economic sanctions or embargos. In the case of Burma, the Commission did indeed propose, as Mr Henderson mentioned, excluding the country from the privileges of the overall system of generalized preferences. And that is all, bearing in mind that the cooperation agreement with Burma has also been suspended and that the Commission has ruled out the possibility of Burma being able to benefit from any Community programme through ASEAN. Also, as we have said, the Commission will not take the initiative in extending the 1980 agreement in Burma"s favour. We will not do that unless, of course, the Council tells us to, but there will be no initiative on the part of the Commission.
</p>
<p class="contents">Mr President, I should like to make a general comment, which I hesitate to do for fear of being misunderstood. There is a need to greatly improve the human rights policy, because it is clear that a situation arose last year which was very difficult to explain to public opinion – you all know what I am talking about. And a series of decisions was taken with respect to a large country, which meant that the unanimity and cohesion of the European Union were broken. Public opinion thinks that human rights and other Community policies are interpreted or should be interpreted depending on the amount of investment and the balance of trade of the Member States. Investment is this much, the Member States" balance of trade is that much, and that is how the democratic clause should be interpreted. What I am talking about is something we must revise in the future, because that is the negative interpretation which is being made at the moment.
</p>
<p class="contents">However, as for these discussions, I agree with Mr Henderson: the European Parliament should not repeat that mistake either, and I am referring to its intervention, because – and this is what I did not dare to say, but I say it respectfully, to provoke thought – many of you have asked for explanations as to why a company from another country, of another nationality, has invested in a country which is experiencing problems. And if the human rights game in the European Parliament – and I say this respectfully – is going to mean one Member saying, “A company from your country invested in that country’ and another Member saying, “Well, a company from 
<span class="italic">
your</span> country invested in another country’, then I think all of us – the Council, the Commission and Parliament – will be doing a disservice to the human rights cause. Since the current situation is very difficult – because it is true that at certain times double standards, double measures and double language are being applied – I think what we have to do between us is calm things down and try to regain our consistency on human rights as soon as possible.
</p>
<p class="contents">Forgive me for that comment, but I think it is something which needed to be pointed out by the Commission, because we cannot of course implement active policies to sanction one particular company or another because in the end, as I am sure you will understand, that becomes unmanageable in political terms.

President‐in‐Office of the Council</span>. – Mr President, the European Union is committed to helping Albania achieve reconciliation and a return to normality. The Union"s political dialogue meeting with Albania last month is an important sign of this. But the primary responsibility for this recovery rests with the Albanians themselves, the government, the opposition and, indeed, the people of Albania.
</p>
<p class="contents">The Union welcomes the positive steps taken so far by the government and its commitment to restoring law and order and political and economic reform. The agreement with the IMF is an important step forward. The Union encourages the continuing process of democratic reform including the judicial system. It is important that a new constitution is adopted after a wide‐ranging discussion and the Union welcomes the constructive approach Albania is playing in regional issues and, in particular, in Kosovo.
</p>
<p class="contents">It is important that the government works to build a genuinely non‐political civil service. The necessary cuts in public administration agreed with the IMF should be even‐handed and aim to promote a high degree of professionalism and impartiality. But the European Union is concerned at the continued refusal of important groups within the Albanian opposition to engage in the democratic process and to contribute to a common approach to rebuilding their country.
</p>
<p class="contents">The Union calls on the Democratic Party and its allies to participate fully in Parliament including the adoption of a new Albanian Constitution. The Union welcomes the visit of the troika parliamentarians to Tirana last month and urges the government and the opposition to live up to its recommendations. It is important that the cooperation offered by Berisha is fulfilled. The Albanian authorities must work closely with the European Union to ensure the most effective delivery of aid.
</p>
<p class="contents">European Community assistance to Albania between 1991 and 1996 amounted to ECU 557 million. The European Community pledged around ECU 100 million more at the October 1997 international donors conference. The PHARE Programme of 1998 will make an additional ECU 42 million available. The European Union Humanitarian Office has contributed substantial amounts of humanitarian aid to Albania. Last December it announced projects of more than ECU 10 million to help vulnerable sections of the population. This is in addition to the hundreds of millions of US dollars pledged nationally by European Union Member States at the Brussels donors conference.

However, in questions of security the situation is still worrying, and the collecting up of weapons has not been very effective so far. Most important of all, there are still major political tensions between the main parties, and it must be realized that, for the moment, Albania is still a long way from being a genuinely democratic culture.
</p>
<p class="contents">Nevertheless, it is critical that the main opposition party, the Albanian Democratic Party, should participate in the Albanian Parliament and in the drafting of the constitution. Without the necessary political stability, all the country"s forces for recovery and reform, both those from Albania and those from the international donors, would be seriously threatened. In that context, the Commission is pleased with the recent joint mission of the European Parliament, the Parliamentary Assemblies of the Council of Europe and the OSCE. We think that mission was necessary, and it has confirmed acceptance of the June‐July 1997 elections and the legitimacy of the current parliament, and has given ample support to the process of drafting the constitution, which the government has set in motion.
</p>
<p class="contents">As a result of the mission, the Democratic Party is finally considering returning to parliament, and the government seems to be firmly committed to helping with political normalization, but the pressure will certainly have to be kept up on all the parties in order to further political and parliamentary cooperation.
</p>
<p class="contents">The Commission completely agrees with the proposals made by the tri‐parliamentary mission. And in the context of the third joint European Community‐/Council of Europe programme for Albania, with a value of ECU 1.5 million, there is a desire to support the work of the Venice Commission towards the preparation of the constitution. This programme also includes aid for training judges, developing the legislative framework, maintaining law, progress in human rights law, and reforming the judicial system and local administration.
</p>
<p class="contents">All this has an obvious link with the administrative reform programme, which is another key option in the PHARE programme. As regards the agreed measures, an encouraging first result is the government"s approval of a law to transform the state service into a superior auditing institution. Also in preparation is a law concerning the basis of the reorganization of the Ministry of Justice, and a constitutional budgetary law. These two advances – concerning the judiciary and the budget – will be fundamental in reforming public administration.
</p>
<p class="contents">On the other hand, it is important that personnel cuts are carried out as part of the public administration reform process. These cuts have already been agreed with the Bretton Woods institutions, and maintain the necessary criteria of professionalism. In this context, a decree is being approved which deals with transitional measures relating to contracts and dismissals, and it will be revised by experts.
</p>
<p class="contents">If implemented, all this legislation – which I am describing in detail because it is a condition for budgetary aid through the PHARE programme – would release a first sum of ECU 9 million. Just last week there was a Commission identification mission to see how the country"s political normalization is progressing.
</p>
<p class="contents">As for the dramatic problem created by the pyramid scam and the bank fraud in Albania, administrators and auditors have been appointed for those companies which suffered bankruptcy, within the framework of the International Monetary Fund and the World Bank, and they have started work already.
</p>
<p class="contents">Nevertheless, it must be realized that there are quite a few problems in applying the measures being taken to remedy this situation, which was created by the pyramid fraud. It is difficult to carry out inspections and audits because the companies are not keen to cooperate with the administrators and auditors. This issue, which is very sensitive and has a huge social impact, will be thoroughly dealt with during the next coordination meeting, to be held on 23 February and due to be chaired by the World Bank in collaboration with the International Monetary Fund. The Commission is insisting that the Albanian government should facilitate the work of the international administrators, and it is very important that these audits should produce results. That would allow the International Monetary Fund"s emergency programme and the negotiations with the Fund to become a reality, which would of course set Albania into a pattern of normalization, at least with respect to its international economic relations.

<span class="italic">
(IT)</span> Mr President, I had the honour of taking part in this mission with Mrs Pack, which I believe was the first tri‐parliamentary mission in the history of our Parliament. It is an extraordinary event and we can certainly be satisfied with it, but satisfaction with the result of this mission should not be confused with a calm state of mind in relation to the internal situation in Albania because, as Commissioner Marín has just recalled, the situation remains worrying from an economic and safety point of view. We have to realize that a race is taking place in Albania and we do not yet know who the winner will be. On the one hand, there are those who want a process of national reconciliation and an effective democracy and, on the other, there are those who still want revenge over the electoral process.
</p>
<p class="contents">It is true that in Albania, compared with a year ago when there was a kind of civil war, there is now a parliament and a government and constant efforts are being made to put things back in their places. It is true that the situation has improved, but if the government and the opposition do not soon work together to cooperate and complete the new constitution in the parliament and if there is no cooperation within the parliament itself, then conflicts will emerge outside parliament, throughout the country, and the arms used will not be those of deliberation and democracy. Every day, the press reports news that, luckily, does not end up on the international pages, because it concerns local incidents of deaths and injuries, and fights for which those responsible are often not easy to trace.
</p>
<p class="contents">The constitutional block in Albania was the fundamental reason for this mission. The cooperation of all the political powers is required to draw up a constitution. The opposition, however, has not yet participated in the work of the Committee on Institutional Affairs, giving as a reason, the fact that the parliament does not have the moral authority to rewrite the new constitution, and this gives us cause for concern. With our tri‐parliamentary mission, we sought to convince all our partners that a parliament, formed as a result of a laborious response from the ballot‐boxes but also universally recognized as acceptable, is a parliament that is also legitimized to draw up the new constitution.
</p>
<p class="contents">We said, however, that we needed to overcome this block; it seemed to us that our words had been heeded with renewed attention and we had the feeling, as Commissioner Marín pointed out a short while ago, that in the days immediately following our visit, new political events took place. Nevertheless, there was no specific or material follow‐up to the declarations made immediately after our visit and, since our return, there has still been no follow‐up within parliament and the Committee on Institutional Affairs as regards working together on the new constitution. Simple declarations must be made: we need to insist that the Council and the Commission follow our tri‐parliamentary mission with further measures. I have heard positive comments in this respect.
</p>
<p class="contents">We, as members of this Parliament, will have to comply with two commitments we have assumed in this respect: firstly, the formation of an international group of advisers with the task of contributing towards the definition of the status and content of the new constitution; and secondly, the observation of the parliamentary work in Albania. This is a somewhat unusual commitment, but if we take the situation into account we can easily understand why it has been established. In a fairly delicate context, we wanted to illustrate the requirement that the three organizations should dedicate themselves to observing the parliamentary work, with the agreement of the Albanian parliament.
</p>
<p class="contents">Having said that, other things are also useful. To give an example, and addressing Commissioner Marín and the President‐inOffice of Council in particular, I believe that we should establish roots in the territory because, although the national government has good intentions, we cannot take it for granted that its supporters throughout the country have the same good intentions of working towards national reconciliation. To use an image, there is still fire smouldering under the ashes! We therefore need to ensure that democracy flourishes in the territory, at local level. I have heard talk of initiatives the Commission would support financially. In this context, I would suggest that financing be assigned to a particular twinning project between the Albanian local authorities and the local authorities of our Member States. This would create a network of connections that would allow democracy to exist at local level throughout Albania, and would help overcome the temptation to resort to arms, by establishing a common desire for reconciliation.

<span class="italic">
(DE)</span> Mr President, ladies and gentlemen, I can subscribe fully to 98 % of your statement. That does not happen very often, that our two sides are in such agreement, but on what you said about Albania I am almost completely in agreement with you.
</p>
<p class="contents">The fact is, Renzo and I were the two participants from this Parliament in this tripartite attempt at reconciliation. The fact is, however, that reconciliation in this country between the two hostile camps has not yet been achieved and will not be achieved for some time to come. It is constantly being undermined by both sides.
</p>
<p class="contents">The language alone is revealing. There, the leader of the opposition calls the parliament a Kalashnikov parliament. The Prime Minister publicly calls the opposition a terrorist group and their leaders are called criminals with immunity. It is therefore hard for a fruitful coexistence to flourish. As the then socialist opposition did two years ago, the conservative opposition is now boycotting the Parliament. We have always made it unmistakeably clear that a return to parliament is absolutely essential and it is also important for the opposition party, for it is only there that we shall listen to them.
</p>
<p class="contents">The joint action, as Mr Imbeni has said already, was important. It was unique in its cooperation and therefore it was of major significance to the Albanian public and the political representatives. We all listened and our conclusions took into consideration all points of view on the internal politics.
</p>
<p class="contents">The results included the fact that, firstly, amongst other things, the democratic place for decision‐making was in the parliament and therefore the Democratic Party should finally return there.
</p>
<p class="contents">Secondly, the parliament must, however, observe the dignity of the individual member and adhere to the democratic rules of the game, and in this respect the observation carried out by representatives of the OSCE or the Council of Europe should be helpful.
</p>
<p class="contents">Thirdly, we also of course expect that the middle management staff, particularly in the legal field – and you referred to this earlier, Commissioner – which in recent years was trained with our money, are not arbitrarily thrown out into the street, but that use is made of their experience.
</p>
<p class="contents">Fourthly, Albania needs a constitution, particularly for important investment projects. According to existing law, the parliamentary committee should draw up the draft constitution, it should be accepted with a majority of two thirds and them – as they have committed themselves – a referendum by the public should decide. I think that the composition of the committee destined to carry out all these procedures must be somewhat improved.
</p>
<p class="contents">News in recent days reports, on the one hand, illegal police attacks on supporters of the Democratic Party, while on the other hand, the same event is represented as deliberate provocation of the police by the Democratic Party. I find myself unable to say which of these is right. It is very difficult to know from here but it proves one thing, that the fronts between the political camps are very firm and appear almost insurmountable and that force is the language of the politicians. A joint action, such as we have undertaken can only be implemented once. We do not churn them out on a conveyor belt. As you have rightly said Commissioner, it is the job of politicians in Albania now to take their own fate into their hands at last and, if it is at all possible – and I address this both to the Council and the Commission – I would make a heartfelt request for pressure from both sides. I do not mean gentle pressure but really energetic pressure, so that they finally get together in reconciliation and in the interests of the tormented people of Albania.

<span class="italic">
(EL)</span> Mr President, the situation and lot of Albania has often been debated in this House, and frequently with some intensity. Today, we are here with balanced and constructive common positions. These are mainly due to the successful mission of the 
<span class="italic">
ad hoc</span> delegation which, with Mr Imbeni and Mrs Pack, recently visited Tirana. hey tried to bring the opposition back into parliament and succeeded in a first approach on issues of exceptional sensitivity, such as the working out of the new constitution amongst others. Special congratulations are due to them both. In any case, we have all expressed them on the Committee on Foreign Affairs, and we meant it very sincerely.
</p>
<p class="contents">As has already been said many times, the situation in Albania remains fragile and fraught with tensions, even though some progressive steps have been taken. There are always incidents, as Mrs Pack also said earlier. Democratic awareness according to the Western European model is not yet the main factor in public life, and never has been, to this day.
</p>
<p class="contents">As for the European Parliament, regardless of any preference we may have for one side or the other, we must continue to support truly democratic procedures in Albania, offering our experience and assistance to the extent that we can, to help that country find its European orientation as soon as possible.
</p>
<p class="contents">In this respect, our joint motion expresses that intention and wish, and defines the objectives that must be achieved.
</p>
<p class="contents">Finally, Commissioner, I would like to ask whether the European Parliament is to be informed about the talks you said were to take place on Monday regarding Albania at the World Bank.

(PPE).</span> – 
<span class="italic">
(EL)</span> Mr President, I must say that the joint resolution which has been circulated is a text which, I think, will attract wholehearted support from Parliament because it is well balanced and reflects not only common positions but also the common anxiety of us all about what is going on in Albania. In my view, the problem has become focused solely on the restoration of normal relations between the political forces in Albania. My opinion is that this can only be achieved through the correct operation of the Albanian parliament. Events or investigations which concern penal injustices that took place before the events of last year can often be used as a means to persecute political opponents, and that must be avoided.
</p>
<p class="contents">I must say that a very important proposal is the one included among those agreed by the tripartite delegation in which Mrs Pack and Mr Imbeni took part with parliamentarians from the Council of Europe and the Organization for Security and Cooperation in Europe, that is, the proposal that an advisory group should be formed. I would like to go still further and say that the advisory group in question should comprise not academics, not 
<span class="italic">
ex‐cathedra</span> specialists, but Members of Parliament who would alternate and could advise, in my view, on a day to day basis, how the Albanian Parliament ought to function. Albania must be approached very carefully, mainly because of the religious differences that exist. Despite its various religious persuasions, however, the people of Albania have lived for centuries as a single entity. Having lived in that area, I think that if the advisory group is set up it will be able to achieve a great deal on a day to day basis, giving advice about the operation of parliamentary committees, about what issues to put before the plenary Chamber, etcetera. It will also have the opportunity to make contacts, and most importantly, to offer advice about the formulation of a constitution which, as we have been told, the present government intends to submit to the Albanian people in a referendum.
</p>
<p class="contents">I hope all will go well. I hope this, because I am an optimist. Those people deserve better luck and wholehearted and devoted support from Europe's peoples and governments. It is not enough for the Commission and the Council to tell us how much money they are giving, they must also back the European Parliament's initiatives.

<span class="italic">
(IT)</span> Mr President, I think we all agree on one point, and that is that Albania is still in an emergency situation: the problems remain serious, arms are widespread – around one and a half million –, the Mafia continues to benefit – it is calculated that US$6 billion are handled by the Albanian Mafia – and the situation is still precarious from the point of view of reconstructing democracy.
</p>
<p class="contents">I believe that the road to be followed, as indicated by Mr Imbeni and strongly supported by Mr Pack, is to insist that the transition to democracy, which has just been delicately begun, can be followed, starting with the parliament, and therefore the insistence that the parliament explains its own tendencies. I would like to tell the President‐in‐Office of Council that we can also help a return to normality with a more complex, more fundamental policy.
</p>
<p class="contents">The Albanian question cannot be separated from the other questions in a particularly delicate area. When, at the recent Madrid Summit, the Balkans and Albania are, so to speak, cut off from a policy of safety, a policy of attention, that should be considered globally, mistakes are made. We are not without the means: the means are there. NATO is assisting with the rebuilding of the Albanian fleet, the WEU and the OECD are helping the police regain a professionalism they had lost, and there are means of creating the conditions of impartiality to which Commissioner Marín referred.
</p>
<p class="contents">The other economic and financial questions should be aimed at implementing the programme presented by the government. They relate to socio‐democratic infrastructures that should be established and I believe that, with the means we have made available, we can pressurize all parties into bringing Albania into a greater period of normality.

<span class="italic">
(IT)</span> Mr President, there is no doubt that, as the Members have shown, the state of emergency is, unfortunately, not yet over in Albania. The situation is anything but resolved and, for these reasons, we have to say that the action carried out by our representatives, Mr Imbeni and Mr Pack, together with the OECD and the Council of Europe, has been excellent, and the agreement signed by the parties, namely, the government powers and the opposition, is an important starting point.
</p>
<p class="contents">Unfortunately, however, we cannot be under the illusion that this is the answer to the problems. I repeat, it is an essential starting point for drawing up a new constitution, which is necessary at the moment; but a new constitution is not drawn up without the involvement of the opposition and, at the moment, the signs are unfortunately anything but favourable. One opposition party is currently saying that the agreement is a partial agreement, an agreement that can only be observed provided the Fatos Nano government nullifies all the measures it has taken since it came to power.
</p>
<p class="contents">This is obviously an impossible condition for the government to accept when the government has been prepared to ensure maximum transparency in the parliamentary action so that every right is provided for the opposition, an opposition which is entitled to one‐third of the chairmanship and two‐thirds of the deputy chairmanship of the parliamentary committees.
</p>
<p class="contents">The signs are not favourable at the moment: incidents and further use of arms have been seen in the north, while in the south the territory is still not under the control of the police force; the region around Tirana is beginning to show signs of intolerance owing to the shortage of adequate consumer goods and the lack of solutions to the economic problems it was hoped the new government would be able to resolve.
</p>
<p class="contents">In view of all this, the EU should commit itself much further to offering economic aid and aid aimed at restoring democracy and control in the region. Without this, there is a further risk that civil war will break out again.

(DA)</span> I would like to thank Doug Henderson for a very clear reply, which I can recognise as a repeat of the reply which Mr Henderson gave to a previous question in the British House of Commons. It is of course enlightening that the Treaty has to be accepted by all countries to become law, and if a country does not ratify the Treaty, the countries which are interested in doing something new must call an Intergovernmental Conference. Then, 15 countries must sign to do something new, as has already happened when it was impossible for all the countries to agree to have a social protocol, but 12 signatures established closer cooperation for 11 countries. But everyone must sign to amend the Treaty. I am grateful to Mr Henderson for giving such a clear answer today.

I would like people to know that in Ireland we will have a referendum on the Amsterdam Treaty and already the EU Commission is interfering by sending out propaganda to members of the public. I would like some sort of assurance from the Council that this will not actually happen because it is an interference in the democratic process of a Member State. There should be no undue influence using European taxpayers' money to promote propaganda forcing people to vote in favour of the Treaty. It is up to the Irish people themselves to decide whether they want to vote in favour or against. I would like an assurance from the Council that the EU Commission will actually step aside from the process on this and allow the people to make up their own mind and that it will be in accordance with the constitution of Ireland which prohibits the use of public money to promote one side of the argument in a referendum.

</p>
<p class="contents">Question No 2 by Mihail Papayannakis (H−0004/98)
</p>
<p class="contents">Subject: Information gathering by the Member States
</p>
<p class="contents">A number of authoritative European newspapers have reported that the British secret services gather information of a diplomatic, economic, technological and commercial nature in other Member States of the Union which is used, among other things, to improve the Government's negotiating position at meetings of Community bodies.
</p>
<p class="contents">In the Council's view, to what extent and in what manner are the final outcomes of meetings of Community bodies and their decisions, including those of the Council itself, distorted by such practices which enable certain Member States to be briefed in advance of the negotiating positions of their partners? Can it confirm that such sensitive information is not passed on to third countries, particularly in the context of international trade and other negotiations or final preparations for the euro (e.g. ideas and proposals on the definitive rates of exchange of Community currencies against the euro), since if such information became public knowledge, it could have a huge impact on the international money markets? In the Council's estimation, how many other Member States, and which, engage in similar information gathering?
</p>
<p class="contents">Question No 3 by Nel van Dijk (H−0035/98)
</p>
<p class="contents">Subject: Is MI6 spying on Britain's European partners?
</p>
<p class="contents">Is MI6, the British foreign security service, spying on Britain's European partners with a view to collecting information which the British Government can use to its advantage in international negotiations? Does MI6 record confidential conversations, and does it tap telephone calls<a href="#def_8_1" name="ref_8_1"><sup>(1)</sup></a>

?
</p>
<p class="contents">In what way are MI6's espionage activities directed at civil servants from other EU Member States consistent with the British Government's aspiration towards “moral leadership’ in Europe?
</p>
<p class="contents">Does the Council share my view that a government which uses its security services to gather confidential information on its EU partners and their positions in international negotiations undermines the trust which Member States might have in each other and abuses the solidarity which the Member States might expect from each other in an “ever closer union’?
</p>
<p class="contents">Are there other Member States which instruct, or allow, their security services to spy on their European partners?
</p>
<p class="contents">Can the Council give an assurance that the European Parliament and the Commission are not the target of activities by MI6 or any other security service of any other Member State?

Perhaps I should interpret this as a tacit confirmation of what is happening. But surely it cannot be the case, and I would really like to hear Mr Henderson"s view on this – that the Presidency of the European Union has nothing to say, and has no opinion about the fact that one of its Member States is spying on the others to determine its strategy during negotiations? I would really like to have a very clear answer on this.

.</span> – Question No 4 by Angela Kokkola (H−0008/98)
</p>
<p class="contents">Subject: Human cloning
</p>
<p class="contents">Public opinion is disturbed at the decision taken by the American scientist, Richard Seed, to undertake experiments aimed at creating human clones, which is morally and scientifically unacceptable.
</p>
<p class="contents">In view of the above, will the Council say whether the necessary legislation exists at EU level to ban the cloning of human beings? Even if it does, this is still not enough. Will it therefore also say whether it intends to launch an initiative to establish an international convention banning the cloning of human beings in order to protect citizens from the “brilliant discoveries’ of scientists who sacrifice the ethical dimension of the issue on the altar of scientific research and prestige?

<span class="italic">
President‐in‐Office of the Council</span>. – I am pleased, in relation to Question No 3, to acknowledge the important influence and responsibility of the Council on this matter.
</p>
<p class="contents">The question of bioethics, and in particular protection of human dignity and of the individual, is a key consideration in Community research policy. Research into modification of the human gene is among the most sensitive ethical issues in the field of science and therefore requires constant scrutiny and clear limitations. This fact has been well understood in the European Union and its Member States for many years and has given rise to arrangements for the ethical supervision of human gene research, as well as to legal safeguards and limitations.
</p>
<p class="contents">The Community's Fourth Framework Programme on research contains an explicit provision that no support will be provided to projects which may contravene the European Convention on Human Rights, the Charter of the United Nations or the Council of Europe Convention on Human Rights and Biomedicine. The provisions on biomedical ethics provide that no research into modification of the genetic constitution of human beings, or into human cloning, may be carried out.
</p>
<p class="contents">The Commission's proposal for the fifth research Framework Programme would extend the scope of this exclusion. The proposal is still under consideration in the Council but the honourable Member may rest assured that the rights and dignity of human beings will continue to be the guiding principle behind all decisions.
</p>
<p class="contents">As regards international initiatives, the Council will consider with interest any proposals which the Commission may make on this subject.

President‐in‐Office of the Council</span>. – The Council shares the honourable Members" concern about the effect on the situation in Burundi of the flow of arms from third countries and has noted the resolution on Burundi adopted by the European Parliament at its 15‐19 December 1997 part‐session. The Council has issued similar statements and declarations about the situation in Burundi, most recently on 7 January 1998. The Council has also noted the resolution on a code of conduct on arms exports adopted by the European Parliament at its 12‐16 January 1998 part‐session.
</p>
<p class="contents">The European Council in Amsterdam on 16‐17 June 1997 underlined the vital role of concerted international efforts towards proper regulation of arms exports and called for the development of a coherent arms export control policy throughout the Union on the basis of the common criteria identified in the conclusions of the European Councils of 29 June 1991 and 26‐27 June 1992. These criteria include, notably, respect for human rights in the country of destination.
</p>
<p class="contents">To this end the United Kingdom, in conjunction with France, has put forward a draft text for a European Union code of conduct setting high common standards for arms exports by Member States. The text is in two parts. Firstly, an elaboration of the eight common criteria agreed in 1991 and 1992 in line with the United Kingdom's national criteria which were then announced by the Foreign Secretary of the United Kingdom on 28 July 1997.
</p>
<p class="contents">Secondly, a consultation mechanism providing for partners to circulate information about denials of export licences and requiring a partner to consult the denying partner before coming to a decision on whether to issue an export licence for essentially the same goods to the same client.
</p>
<p class="contents">Initial reactions have been strongly supportive and the aim is for the code to be adopted by a Council declaration during this Presidency.

Could the President‐in‐Office confirm that a Member State which has colonial links with that Great Lakes region of Africa is still unwilling to agree to either an international or a European arms sale embargo on Burundi?
</p>
<p class="contents">Also, I should like to ask the President‐in‐Office whether it might not be a good idea to reactivate UNICOI, which was a commission of inquiry set up when we had the crisis in Rwanda? Would it not be appropriate for us to extend its mandate to Burundi? In my view – and I hope it would be the Council's view as well – it would assist us in our efforts to stop arms trafficking into Burundi and, indeed, within the Great Lakes area.

I would like to ask him if he has seen the information provided by Human Rights Watch showing that a great deal of activity has been going on, based in Ostend? Does he not think that it is important that drastic action should be taken immediately to prevent any further arms from being supplied from Europe and that those people who are involved in this deadly trade should be brought before the courts forthwith? We have spoken early today about the difficulties of arms suppliers to Iraq. They are just as bad in this case.

.</span> – As they deal with the same subject, the following questions will be taken together: 
</p>
<p class="contents">Question No 10 by Patricia McKenna (H−0020/98)
</p>
<p class="contents">Subject: Proposal for an EU code of conduct on the arms trade
</p>
<p class="contents">The British Government has pledged to work for a European code of conduct “setting high common standards governing arms exports’ during its EU presidency.
</p>
<p class="contents">Four non‐governmental organizations (NGOs) – Oxfam, Amnesty International, Safeworld and the British American Society Information Council – recently published a briefing document, outlining the essential standards which such a code of conduct should establish.
</p>
<p class="contents">The briefing argues that there should be no exports of military equipment to states with poor records on respect for human rights and to states which spend more of their GDP on the military than on health and education.
</p>
<p class="contents">Can the Council give details of what progress it has made in formulating a code of conduct on the arms trade? When does it expect to have such a code of conduct completed?
</p>
<p class="contents">Question No 11 by Elisabeth Schroedter (H−0116/98)
</p>
<p class="contents">Subject: Introduction of an EU code of conduct on the arms trade by the British Presidency
</p>
<p class="contents">Britain and France have been developing a common text for the code which has now been agreed. The proposed code is weak on consultation mechanisms, asking only for consultation between Member States directly involved in specific arms exports, and not between all fifteen Member States.
</p>
<p class="contents">What effect do you envisage the code as having on arms exports from the EU? For example, will it stop the transfer of light weapons and armoured personnel vehicles to Indonesia or military attack helicopters to Turkey?
</p>
<p class="contents">Unless there are rigorous controls on the end‐use of arms and military equipment, legitimate exports can be diverted to repressive regimes and countries in regions of instability. End‐use agreements should be legally binding contracts and a system of monitoring end‐use should be implemented.
</p>
<p class="contents">What provisions will the EU code of conduct include for controlling the end‐use for arms and military equipment?
</p>
<p class="contents">Question No 12 by Karin Riis‐Jørgensen (H−0153/98)
</p>
<p class="contents">Subject: Common EU code of practice for arms exports
</p>
<p class="contents">What initiatives does the Presidency intend to take during the first half of the year to ensure that a common EU code of practice is drawn up for arms exports? Will it explain the purpose and contents of a common EU code of practice for arms exports?
</p>
<p class="contents">Will it also explain when it can be expected that any common EU code of practice will be implemented?
</p>
<p class="contents">Question No 13 by Jan Bertens (H−0161/98)
</p>
<p class="contents">Subject: European policy on arms export controls
</p>
<p class="contents">I welcome the initiative taken by the British Presidency with a view to tightening up the rules on arms export controls. The existing criteria, which date back to 1991/92, have been interpreted very broadly and diversely, with the result that there has been no question of a coordinated European policy on arms exports.
</p>
<p class="contents">Does the Council share my view that the criteria must be more concrete and less open to interpretation and that their implementation must be binding in order to eliminate the shortcomings of the existing criteria? Does the Council also agree that multilateral consultation among the Member States is necessary to achieve effective implementation of the European export criteria?
</p>
<p class="contents">What role has the Council assigned to the European Parliament with regard to the formulation of the new export control policy and practical implementation of the relevant rules?
</p>
<p class="contents">What steps will the Council take to encourage the Member States to reach agreements on promoting the transparency and parliamentary supervision of arms exports policy?

<span class="italic">
President‐in‐Office of the Council</span>. – The need for further harmonization of national arms export policies has been raised at various levels within the Council.
</p>
<p class="contents">The European Council in Amsterdam on 16‐17 June 1997 underlined the vital role of concerted international efforts towards proper regulation of arms exports. It therefore called for renewed and sustained attention in the framework of the common foreign and security policy to developing responsible and coherent arms export control policies throughout the Union on the basis of the common criteria identified in the conclusions of the European Councils of 29 June 1991 and 26‐27 June 1992. These criteria include, notably, respect for human rights in the country of destination.
</p>
<p class="contents">In this context, as I have previously indicated, the United Kingdom, in conjunction with France, has put forward a draft text for a European Union code of conduct setting high common standards for arms exports by Member States. The text is in two parts: an elaboration of the eight common criteria agreed in 1991 and 1992 in line with the United Kingdom's national criteria announced by the United Kingdom Foreign Secretary on 28 July 1997. These specify inter alia that a licence should be refused where there is a clearly identifiable risk that the proposed export might be used for internal repression or international aggression. They further provide for a consultation mechanism for partners to circulate information about denials of export licences and requiring a partner to consult the denying partner before coming to a decision on whether to issue an export licence for essentially the same goods to the same client.
</p>
<p class="contents">Initial reactions have been strongly supportive and the aim is for the code to be adopted by Council declaration during the United Kingdom's Presidency. The honourable Members may also be aware that the Italian delegation submitted to the Council at its 10 November 1997 session a suggestion on the implementation of the eight common criteria.

<span class="bold">
(V).</span> – As regards this proposed code of conduct, there are quite a number of deficiencies in it, for example the fact that only arms exporting countries will be able to call the shots on who buys their arms if this code of conduct is adopted. That means countries like Ireland, which has no major arms industry, will have little say in how the EU arms policy would be implemented. This seems to be a version of ‚honour amongst thieves’ in that it is the countries involved in the arms industry which will make the decisions, and countries which have an ethical position as regards arms exports will have no say. As well as that, there is a need for transparency, because commercial confidentiality means this subject will remain secret.
</p>
<p class="contents">With regard to the delivery of arms, they would be allowed into countries which have not signed international human rights conventions. The export to regimes with poor human rights records would be allowed if the weapons were to be used to protect the police. There are many oppressive regimes, such as Turkey and Indonesia, which could take advantage of this. I should like the President‐in‐Office to say that the Council is going to address these issues and will bring these points of concern into a code of conduct, otherwise it is just window‐dressing.

<span class="bold">
.</span> – There are a lot of points raised in the honourable lady's questions. I do not accept that there are any major deficiencies in the code that is being proposed. This code is a major step forward which concentrates the minds of European Union countries on what their responsibilities are in relation to the sale of arms. It provides for a transparency so that those countries know what is happening in relation to the arm sales of other European Union countries. It also provides a mechanism for preventing one country selling arms to a third country when that third country has already been denied an importation facility by another European Union country. In other words protecting the integrity of the policy.
</p>
<p class="contents">People will always look for ways of circumventing regulations, codes and so on. That will always be the case. There is now a huge moral pressure on all the European Union Members, assuming that a satisfactory code is concluded, to deal with this matter in a completely new fashion.
</p>
<p class="contents">The question of the criteria which decides whether or not an arms sale takes place is essentially a separate matter. Where the arms are likely to be used, for example, for internal repression or external aggression, then those arms sales should not take place. The problem at the moment is that it does not prevent another country making the sale if one country decides that the potential importer does not meet those criteria.
</p>
<p class="contents">There is a period of consultation which is now taking place within the Union. It is an opportunity for any Member State, or any lobby within a Member State, to look at ways in which the code can be more effective and make their views known. I believe that the Council will have an open mind on how the code can be improved. I invite all Members of the Parliament, if they have views, to submit them through the appropriate channels so that they can be made known. The purpose is to ensure that we have a system with an internal integrity and I believe that what is currently proposed is a major step forward.

<span class="italic">
(DE)</span> Mr President, I am rather disappointed by the Council"s answer, because we submitted our questions in writing in good time. These questions were very much more concrete than your answer, which you have just repeated for the third time. It is in fact a matter of whether, for example, it is possible that in future the Turkish government will as ever get weapons to fight the Kurdish population and to bombard the Kurdish population. Is that, as ever, possible? This specific question was asked and we would like a specific answer. We have also asked you, what is more, in writing, whether you provide a check on the route and also a check on the end user, and how this looks in real terms. I would like to ask you to answer these questions, which were before you in good time, in terms as specific as those in which they were asked.
</p>
<p class="contents">I have one final question. You said there are positive reactions. From whom did these positive reactions come? From the arms industry, perhaps?
</p>

<span class="bold">
.</span> – I thank the honourable lady for her question. The aim of having a policy at European Union level is to try to have a consistency across the Union with a view to eventually having a wider consistency outside the European Union which is equally as important.
</p>
<p class="contents">At the moment I understand there are some European Union countries who have taken a decision that where there is a likelihood that arms sales to Turkey would be used for internal repression, then those sales will not be made. As mentioned earlier, the aim of the code is to try to bring about a consistency across the European level. There will be arguments about what is internal repression and to what extent there is internal repression.
</p>
<p class="contents">It would be impossible to eliminate arguments among European Union Members on an issue like that. There will always be borderline decisions on which there will always be arguments. The important thing about the code is that it establishes a common criteria and a way of ensuring that those common criteria are applied, although it must always include an element of judgement. I think those who are involved in the detail of those decisions will recognize the need for that judgement.

<span class="italic">
(NL)</span> I thank the President‐in‐Office for his reply. I congratulate him on the fact that the British Presidency now wholeheartedly agrees with what we have been requesting here for so long. Yet there was one question you did not answer: which role does he think he will give to the European Parliament when a new export control policy comes into being? On that point I wanted to ask – because I know that the Italians have made a proposal to draw up an annual report on arms exports – if this will be adopted by the British Presidency? If not, why not? If so, then I think this would be excellent.
</p>
<p class="contents">I would like to say in conclusion that it would seem better to me, when it concerns consultation about which countries does what with another, that this should not be so much a bilateral consultation, but a multilateral consultation, because only then will the code of conduct become a code for all countries.

.</span> – I can say to the honourable gentlemen that I agree with him that it is important to have a multilateral approach which is why this code has been proposed by the Presidency in the first place. I have also indicated that eventually it has to have a wider application than purely within the European Union. Otherwise it could still be undermined.
</p>
<p class="contents">It is important, as a first stage, that those who have strong views on those matters, including the honourable gentleman who clearly does, should concentrate efforts on persuading the governments within the European Union to support a strong code. Once this has been established we can then look at where else there could be consideration of some of these matters within the institutions of the European Union, including the Parliament.

</p>
<p class="contents">My question is as follows: would it not be sensible, when we see that the major proportion of arms exports really do go again and again to the developing countries, to finally link development aid to arms purchase and inform the developing countries that development aid will be reduced as long as they use it for arms purchases.

<span class="bold">
.</span> – I understand the point that has been made about developing countries. It would obviously be a misuse of aid if aid given for other purposes were used to purchase military equipment. There is bound to be an element of military equipment in the purchasing portfolio of a developing country. They need to have law and order internally and there is a need for defence externally. A judgement has to be made about that. Clearly if a developing country is spending all of its other resources on the purchase of military equipment and then relying on a certain amount of aid for social expenditure then there is something wrong in the balance of that country's use of resources.
</p>
<p class="contents">I think it would be right to have a dialogue with that country to make it clear that a reasonable balance of resources for legitimate law and order or external defence expenditure is something which is acknowledged. Aid directed to that country should not, in normal circumstances, be used for that purpose. In some developing countries where there has been a period of crisis and anarchy one of the first things to establish any economic recovery is to bring about a degree of law and order and it may be appropriate for aid expenditure to help to bring about that process. It may be that some hardware has to be part  of that and indeed I know of some examples where that is the case and I would say it was legitimate. But that would be the exception rather than the rule.

</p>
<p class="contents">I also have some additional questions: What rules are going to apply? Will they call for majority decisions or unanimity? Who will make the decisions? Finally, is it intended that the EU regulations should replace national regulations on weapons exports to other countries, or will the national regulations even be taken over?

.</span> – I can say to Mr Lindqvist that there was in fact a discussion on some of those matters in the working group which took place yesterday. Clearly, for a framework agreement to come about there would need to be unanimity among Union Members on the way that the code would work. If the current provisions are eventually agreed, and this is repetition to some extent, a country which felt that the export of arms would mean the likelihood of those arms being used for internal repression or external aggression and which therefore blocked the sale of those arms would then be able to say to other countries ‚this is a position which we have adopted’.
</p>
<p class="contents">If another country then decides that they wish to take up those export orders they will be bound by the Court to come back to the original country which would then stimulate a dialogue on the rights or wrongs of the arms sale taking place. The criterion should be the purpose of the arms, not the state of the domestic arms industry and that is a very important criterion which is built into the code. The problem of the current situation where there is no code which is effective arises when one country says ‚we do not believe that arms should be sold to a third country because of the likelihood of internal repression or external aggression, but if we do not sell them somebody else will and it will be trading our jobs for somebody else's jobs and therefore we should not make the decision initially to block the sale’.
</p>
<p class="contents">The purpose of the code is to get over that very important issue because the arms industry is a big industry in a number of European Union countries. The workpeople in that industry are saying ‚why should it be our jobs that are sacrificed if someone else is going to jump in and take the order up in another country?’. This code is intended to answer that question. It does not mean it is the end of the matter. There need to be other industrial policies which Member States adopt, or which might be part of an employment strategy for the Union itself, which would also address the needs of those workers who are no longer able to get employment in handling those export orders and who have to look for redeployment conversion and so on. It is an important starting point but it is not the end of the matter.

The President‐in‐Office has answered my question about how undercutting can be prevented in Europe between EU Member States when they are selling arms to a third country, but perhaps the President‐in‐Office would like to consider the question of end use which has often created problems in the past in tracing the eventual recipient country. Would he like to perhaps give a response on the issue of end use?

.</span> – I am grateful to the honourable Member for that question because it raises another very real problem which has to be addressed in the code. My current thinking – although I do not have a completely closed mind on it – is that there has to be an element of discretion. Judgments have to be made not only on the likelihood of those arms being used for internal repression or external aggression but the likelihood of where that will happen. In other words, will the arms be resold to some other party and, when they are resold, would there be a high likelihood of internal repression or external aggression?
</p>
<p class="contents">It is probably extremely difficult to deal with that other than on the basis of giving discretion to the nation which would initially be making the export order. However, it may be that there can be some facility for an exchange of views on this matter so that as full information as possible is always made available to all European Union Member States. It may be that an obligation should be written into the code that where a Member State believes there is a further follow‐through trade in arms, that information should be made available to European Union Member States.

.</span> – I am very grateful to the honourable lady for her recognition that the general thrust of the proposed code would be broadly supported across the political divide of Parliament. That reflects a very practical understanding of some of the very difficult issues. I am very aware of them myself, as there is a large tank factory on the edge of my old constituency back in Newcastle‐upon‐Tyne in northern England. The people working in that factory and the sub‐contractors are very aware of this difficult problem. They have as ethical a view of foreign policy as any one else but it is their job which is at stake.

<span class="italic">
President‐in‐Office of the Council.</span> – The Presidency has three key priorities for the Consumer Council: the Consumer Guarantees Directive; more effective enforcement of existing consumer protection; and improvements to the European home and leisure accidents surveillance system. Progress in these areas will help consumers in all countries.
</p>
<p class="contents">Firstly, the Consumer Guarantees Directive will give basic rights to consumers faced by unsatisfactory goods. The remedies in the directive – repair, replacement, reduction in price, refund – are easy to understand. People need to understand their rights if they are to exercise them. Consumers should thus be able to take full advantage of the single market in the way businesses can. In some countries consumer rights would be improved by the directive. In the rest, existing high levels of protection would remain. We await the European Parliament's first reading on the directive and are aiming for a common position at the April Consumer Council.
</p>
<p class="contents">There is no point in having consumer protection rules if they are not properly implemented and enforced. We want the April Consumer Council to examine this on the basis of a Commission report. To give one example, mechanisms for Member States to share best practice should make it easier to act against trading scams and to identify unsafe products.
</p>
<p class="contents">Our third aim is to improve the European home and leisure accidents surveillance system. This is used to gather accident data on which to base health and safety policy. Doing that European Union‐wide means a larger population sample and more useful data. We are committed to ensure the system's continuation and to improve it, building on the best current national practice. I hope that we can count on the European Parliament's support to achieve these goals.

This does not prevent any particular Member State deciding that they want to have better standards. There needs to be discretion on some of those matters.

<p class="contents">The Council has decided that tax‐free sales should end in 1999. When this decision was taken, a commitment was given to carry out an analysis of the impact on employment. However, no analysis has been forthcoming.
</p>
<p class="contents">Does the Council intend to ensure that the promised impact analysis is carried out before the decision ending tax‐free sales enters into force?

<p class="contents">Question No 18 by Pat Gallagher (H−0157/98)
</p>
<p class="contents">Subject: Job losses because of indirect tax increases
</p>
<p class="contents">Representatives of those employed in the duty‐ and tax‐free industry claim that a considerable number of jobs, up to 140 000, are at risk should the planned abolition of this trade proceed as is currently planned, and stressed their concerns to MEPs during a demonstration in Brussels in December of last year.
</p>
<p class="contents">As the Commission continues to question the validity of these claims, and at a time when unemployment is a priority throughout the European Union, would the Council confirm what steps it is taking to quantify the number of jobs at risk and to evaluate possible remedial measures?

<span class="italic">
President‐in‐Office of the Council.</span> – As the honourable Members will know, when the Council adopted directives abolishing fiscal frontiers from 1 January 1993, it decided to put an end to tax and duty‐free sales for intra‐European Community passengers because retaining such sales would be inconsistent with an internal market without frontiers. Knowing this decision would require major changes in the sectors concerned, Council provided for a lengthy adjustment period from 1 January 1993 to 30 June 1999 during which tax and duty‐free sales for intra‐EC travellers could be retained. The Council currently has no plans to revisit its decision.
</p>
<p class="contents">The effect on jobs of ending intra‐European Community duty‐free is hard to estimate accurately and depends in part on the nature of the successive regime. Some estimates probably overstate the effect. Whatever the successive regime's nature, operators will still be able to make sales on a duty and tax paid basis.

(SV)</span> I would like to thank Mr Henderson for his answer. It is quite correct that the abolition of duty‐free sales is a step towards the creation of the single market, but the single market is being created to provide economic benefits. Whatever we say, it is still the case that the question of the existence of duty‐free sales has extremely little to do with economic benefits.
</p>
<p class="contents">If we abolish duty‐free sales, to begin with we would incur costs in the form of 50 000 to 100 000 lost jobs. Secondly, a number of ferry lines would be closed, including one which runs between Finland and Sweden and affects my home community, and which in turn has repercussions for tourism in both countries. On the positive side we have some abstract economic gains which perhaps amount to a hundredth or a thousandth of a per cent of the gross domestic product.
</p>
<p class="contents">I would like to ask Mr Henderson the following: Is it really worth it for the sake of this small gain to see so many people made unemployed, and to anger a large proportion of the Union's population?

(SV)</span> Thank you Mr President‐in‐Office. Since it is the case that different countries in the EU have different duties on alcohol, tobacco and perfumes, I wonder whether you could tell me where the duty should be paid when a vessel travels between two or three countries. Should it be paid in the country which has the highest duty or in the country which has the lowest duty? Or could people even buy goods in a third country in the EU and pay the duty in the country which has the lowest duty? It that is the case, is there not then a risk of tax dumping, and is it in that case a desirable development?
</p>
<p class="contents">I listened to John Prescott yesterday. He said that as an ex‐seaman he was concerned about the consequences of abolishing dutyfree sales. On that basis I would like to put the following question: would it not be reasonable to investigate the consequences in the area of employment

.</span> – Mr Andersson, like Mr Wibe, is asking me to revisit the issues that were all very well aired when these matters were first discussed in the early 1990s. There is no intention, currently, on the part of the Council to reopen these matters.
</p>
<p class="contents">Regarding the question of taxation, yes, there are, as the honourable Member will know, different levels of consumption taxes in different countries within the European Union. The answer, in theoretical terms, is that the tax which was appropriate would be paid on the purchase of the product. There will no doubt be books and more books of Treasury and commercial law on those definitions.

(UPE).</span> – At the outset I should like to say that I am extremely disappointed at the response of the President‐in‐Office who continues to say that this will not be revisited. I believe a new Presidency coming into office – a new government – should at least look at this. He referred to the major changes, the long derogation period because of the changes. He must also remember that there were commitments given over the years that a study would be carried out. It is rather alarming that the President‐inOffice is not in a position to give us a clear view of the effects that this might have. It does not surprise me. I do not think any politician or any President‐in‐Office will be able to do that without a study. We have been given that commitment and we have a duty towards the European citizens to give them that study.
</p>
<p class="contents">But it is now becoming patently clear that considerable difficulties will arise should the abolition of duty‐free sales within the EU proceed as planned in mid−1999. The rules for applying and collecting VAT, excise duties on products sold and consumed, duty and tax paid on board the few remaining ferries in existence on intra‐EU routes – that he referred to – are unclear. New arrangements are required. Let the President‐in‐Office tell us what arrangements are required and will be made in view of these changes.

<span class="italic">
(SV)</span> Duty‐free income is of major importance for ferry traffic between Sweden and Finland in the Baltic. North of the Stockholm area – you could say that Stockholm is in southern Sweden – there is only one scheduled ferry link. That goes between the beautiful city of Umeå in Sweden and Vasa in Finland. It is most uncertain whether this ferry traffic will survive a removal of duty‐free sales. That would mean that the heavy lorry traffic which takes this route would have to travel hundreds of kilometres extra with great economic and environmental costs for this area in northern Sweden and Finland. In addition, old historic ties between these areas would be broken. Furthermore, interregional aid is being received for cooperation between these areas in Sweden and Finland.
</p>
<p class="contents">My question is this: does the Council have any objection to the Swedish and Finnish governments intervening and providing direct state aid to maintain this traffic if it cannot survive when duty‐free sales are abolished?

Instead, we must have competition on equal terms. It should not be the case that Europe should try to create new jobs through people getting drunk on a load of ferries.

Thirdly, unemployment is now our top priority; it was not back in 1991.

<p class="contents">As far as I am aware, there was no link in the decision between the change in the regulations on duty‐free and any consideration of taxation. They are two separate issues with no link. So I do not think that argument can be put.

Different Member States within the European Union will have different views on those taxation questions.

<p class="contents">It would be open to any government within the European Union to raise the issue in Ecofin or at the General Affairs Council if they were so minded. It would be up to the other Members of whichever Council it was to make whatever response was appropriate at that time and in the circumstances of how the issue was being raised. But unless that happens, I can say that the Presidency has no intention of reopening this issue which we believe was settled.

What means would it propose to achieve this improved environmental quality, in the light of the existing fundamental lack of capacity within the Commission?

President‐in‐Office of the Council</span>. – The Presidency considers that environmental protection is an integral part of the development process. Lasting elimination of poverty requires environmentally sustainable solutions. Poor people are most reliant on natural resources and most vulnerable to environmental degradation and mismanagement. If natural resources are not managed sustainably, continued economic growth will not be possible.
</p>
<p class="contents">We need to help developing countries integrate environmental concerns into their decision‐making. In particular we will support their efforts to prepare plans and policies for sound management of their natural resources and national strategies for sustainable development.
</p>
<p class="contents">The intermediate targets for sustainable development, based on United Nations conventions and resolutions, anticipate the implementation of these national strategies in all countries by the year 2005 so as to ensure that current trends in the loss of environmental resources are effectively reversed at both global and national levels by the year 2015.
</p>
<p class="contents">Relevant action planned under the Presidency of the European Union will include endeavouring to secure commitments from the Commission and Member States to promote national strategies for sustainable development in developing countries and to adopt measurable targets, especially in sustainable development and poverty reduction, and to help increase the effectiveness of these funds.
</p>
<p class="contents">A Council regulation was recently adopted on environmental measures in developing countries in the context of sustainable development, along with a resolution on environmental assessment in development cooperation. This provides for the mainstreaming of environmental concerns in project and programme preparation, as well as at the strategy and policy levels.

But I do not think that I was given any actual indication at all of how to remedy the situation, given the Commission's lack of capacity at present. In a nutshell, how can we ensure that priority will be given to integrating the environment in implementing the EU's overseas aid programmes and, in view of this, will there be incentives which will be sufficiently effective to ensure that integration also takes place in practice?

<span class="italic">
rapporteur.</span> – Mr President, as rapporteur for this report, I have to say that it is a disappointing report; not in the way it is written – because that is very good – but because as rapporteur I cannot examine the success or failure of air transport liberalization fully without examining the social consequences. The Commission promised to publish results of a study they commissioned last October. I understand it has just been issued this week. So I ask the House to review the results of this report, to review the apparent results of liberalization, bearing in mind that the social effects of that liberalization have still to be taken into account.
</p>
<p class="contents">The rest of liberalization in the air transport industry is a bit like the curate's egg: it is good in parts. We have some cheaper fares, but we have also some increased fares. We have some increased competition; we have some new airlines coming forward; but we have a decline in safety and we have some frightening alliances on the horizon.
</p>
<p class="contents">If we look at cheaper fares, then several no‐frills airlines are offering cheaper fares such as Easyjet, Debonair, Virgin Express. Even British Airways has set up a separate company to offer such no‐frills deals. These, however, are mostly based around the United Kingdom. We need to extend some of these companies to the rest of the European Union. I wish them luck and I commend what they are offering. However, these lower fares must not be at the expense of cutting safety or worsening working conditions. That is why we need to examine the social effects of liberalization.
</p>
<p class="contents">Even with the larger airlines, business fares have dropped on routes where there is competition. But when you look at these fares, even though they have dropped, they are still too high. There is still an unbelievable complexity of fares. We have got PEX, superPEX, Euro‐fares, economy, full economy, business class, and so it goes on. Buying an airline ticket should be simple; it should be straightforward. It is not. Passengers should be able easily to find information on the various service provided for different fares. They cannot. Even though we have got air traffic increasing globally by 7.9 % a year, most people flying are having more difficulty getting the right fares.
</p>
<p class="contents">Safety must be assured. If we look at some of the examples: British Airways removed safety doors from some of its planes to put in more seats. This was not a good move in terms of safety and it was a disastrous move for them as far as PR is concerned. We have a situation now where pilots are flying longer and longer hours. Some of them are flying 17 hours in a day. That must affect safety. Cabin crews are working longer hours for less money and that must compromise safety. This is the unacceptable face of liberalization.
</p>
<p class="contents">Liberalization does have its merits but it is not defect‐free. We need controlled liberalization. By that, I mean we need to put in place preventive measures to avoid the cut‐throat competition that would lead to monopolies the way it did in the United States and in Australia. Their services, consequently, deteriorated. We need a balanced liberalization that will benefit passengers, shareholders and workers in the industry. We need to encourage new entrants and to ensure they are not wiped out by the larger companies before they can get going. To do that we need to solve the slot problem – the problems at airports which they have too much traffic. This is the subject of a separate report that has come into this House, but it needs solving if liberalization is to continue.
</p>
<p class="contents">We need to ensure that the newly emerging airlines and the ones that are offering the reduced fares can get slots so that they can continue and can also fly between some of the regional airports. We also need to look at the alliances that are proposed and in place between the US and European carriers. We need to ensure that these alliances do not destroy our European airlines. Global arrangements must allow the European airlines to compete and passengers to enjoy the benefits of this competition, but not at the expense of their workforces.
</p>
<p class="contents">Liberalization has not been as effective as promised. But the slower, controlled approach is desirable and must extend to all parts of the European Union. If it is to continue, we need to solve the slot allocation problems and to protect new entrants. But we cannot – and I, as rapporteur, cannot – assess the impact of the third liberalization package until we know the social consequences of this stage of liberalization.

<span class="italic">
draftsman of the opinion of the Committee on Economic and Monetary Affairs and Industrial Policy. – (DE)</span> Mr President, ladies and gentlemen, Commissioner, as draftsman of opinion of the Committee on Economic and Monetary Affairs, I agree with the basic statements in Mr Seal"s report and I thank him sincerely for his report. In addition, even if, as he has rightly commented, the Commission knowingly, unknowingly, consciously, or unconsciously has concealed its report on the social consequences, his report is nevertheless a valuable one and I hold Mr Seal in very high esteem.
</p>
<p class="contents">It is true that the air transport liberalization finalized in the past year has completely opened the Single Market to this field and all of us, the actual consumers, are gradually noticing the advantages. National air transport markets were opened up, competition is allowed, even if it is sometimes a little bit strange that an airline from country A has flown cabotage for years in country B without covering its own costs, without making a profit and survives. Well, we shall see if this is actually possible in the long term.
</p>
<p class="contents">Also, the number of routes serviced has risen, the number of operating airlines has risen, yet nevertheless the planes have to a large extent been filled. In that respect, I believe that liberalization has succeeded. My dear Mr Seal, I do not believe that the safety of passengers has been put at risk in any way by the liberalization of the air transport market. All the accidents which have occurred have been outside the area of the European Community and not within it.
</p>
<p class="contents">Of course, the Commission also offers us a glimpse into the areas which have not yet been dealt with, into tariffs, the limitation of capacity, the cost of flight services and access to the market. The Commission is surely right when it says that on many intraCommunity routes, and above all the internal domestic routes, there is still no competition. But Commissioner, I believe that in the case of many routes which today are not even profitable for a single airline – particularly those in peripheral regions – we cannot expect competition, because nobody as it were wants to lose money. That is what we must realize. In that respect, I believe that the Commission has come to the wrong conclusions. I believe that many internal routes are simply not profitable because of insufficient passenger numbers and will not attract competition.
</p>
<p class="contents">What I also agree with in Barry Seal"s report is that the tariff structure is something over which the normal consumer can have no overview. The various cheap and cheaper tariffs and special offers which the airlines offer are simply too difficult to understand. For clever business people and people who have a good travel agent, maybe they can cope, but not normal citizens. That, I believe, must change.
</p>
<p class="contents">I would also like to say something about competition and about the alliances. I do not completely share the view of my colleague, Barry Seal. I believe the European airlines only have a chance in alliances with other partners in other continents. I do share his view that we must be watchful that American partners do not drive our European lines to the wall in these alliances, but we also cannot let the Directorate‐General IV see the Single Market as a total area in which it will judge the competition situation. We must look globally at the question of market restriction, competition and cartel rights, because air traffic also takes place globally in alliances. You all know that the airlines make most profit on the North Atlantic route and not on internal European routes. In this respect, we must ask the Commission – and Karel Van Miert will probably take this into account – to regard the alliances not only as a danger but also as an opportunity for the European airlines to join in global competition. I hope that Neil Kinnock will also say something on his view of the alliances.
</p>
<p class="contents">Finally, I would like to ask the Commission: when will we get the proposals for discussion and decision which are still outstanding? I am referring here to the question of the slots. I am not yet sure when the long‐since announced package on the slots will be placed before us, Commissioner. It needs to be discussed. We should, Mr President, also discuss the question of flight management. There are in fact still too many problems for the passengers and for the airlines, because air control in Europe is simply organized on a pre‐Europe basis. That must be changed. Perhaps you can also say something about this, Commissioner, since the free market can only be effective for environmental protection and our citizens if the air space is used efficiently.

<span class="italic">
(DA)</span> Mr President, Commissioner, ladies and gentlemen, on behalf of the group I would like to thank the rapporteur, Barry Seal, for a good piece of work and a good report, even if it has been a long time coming. The report looks at all the main problems involved in deregulation. For some years, deregulation has been the aim at global, national and European level. We have noticed this, it is happening in a whole host of sectors. But everywhere we find that the problems are the same. How can deregulation and improving services best be carried out without affecting jobs and employee security and without reducing the availability of public services, including transport?
</p>
<p class="contents">It is not least in the field of air traffic that these problems are relevant. This is highlighted in points 1 and 6 of the report. It is just as important to realize the social and employment effects of deregulation in a new competitive situation. I understand that the investigations mentioned in the report are now under way. We must assess these results in terms of their implications for society, and I hope the discussion will be sensible rather than sharp. It is essential that this new situation be dealt with in a sensible fashion.
</p>
<p class="contents">Mr President, something must be wrong in Europe if I can learn from the press that SAS cabin staff are thinking of setting up a strike fund in Panama. We can only shake our heads at this; I do not understand why this is happening. Perhaps things are different in a multinational company, or what is it? If we take a closer look at the competitive situation in Europe, a multi‐coloured picture emerges, even though deregulation is taking place. On some routes, prices are low and the level of service high. On others, it is the opposite. Some routes are just like bus routes where you just turn up and go ahead. There is no overall picture at present of how deregulation is progressing.
</p>
<p class="contents">One of the major problems, as has been said, is that the pricing system is not transparent. It takes an experienced traveller to find their way around the jungle of what is available. But I note that one thing is working on some routes, namely the market mechanism.
</p>
<p class="contents">But it should be the other way round. My impression is that flying is still seen as something rather exclusive in Europe. Perhaps that is why prices per km are higher than in the USA. If it is really true that flying costs 40 % more in Europe than in the USA, it is time the politicians did something. Why is it more expensive? Is it government support? Is it a lack of air traffic control? Is it ground handling? Or is it due to search for profits? Now, of course, we can watch the different companies' profits on the stock markets and make our own assessments. It is quite profitable to run an airline in Europe. Reviewing the costs of flying would lead to both price cuts and better services. Imagine if one day we could fly at a set price per kilometer. Imagine what would happen if we could just say we wanted to travel so and so many kilometres: it would cost x times the number of kilometres. I certainly think that would be fair.
</p>
<p class="contents">More and more frequently, we are seeing new companies being set up and struggling for a few years and then going under. There are not many markets where acquiring market share is such a capital‐intensive business as it is in aviation. But, in many cases – even if the new companies are not around for long – this is enough to worry the established ones. Even if only a few of them survive, they are proof that the market is not completely closed. But there is still a need for regulation. Price agreements and alliances are very serious phenomena which need monitoring.
</p>
<p class="contents">And so, Commissioner, we come to allocating slots. I will be the rapporteur for the report on this: so it is important to us how the market develops in this area in future. We look forward to the Commission's proposals on this. But is it not precisely in the case of the major airports that the problem arises? The problems of air traffic control and air corridors may well be equally interesting. I look forward to seeing the Commission's proposals, and I, for my part, will do my best.
</p>
<p class="contents">When internal flights in Denmark were deregulated, the airlines responded by raising prices. It was not until the Great Belt tunnel was opened, as the Commissioner knows, and railway transport in Denmark became effective that the airlines reduced their fares. That is what we in Denmark call a ring or price fixing. Commissioner, rapporteur, we will consider developments and deregulation; together with the Commission, we have an important job to ensure good flights for passengers and proper conditions for staff.

(PPE).</span> – Mr President, we welcome this opportunity to discuss the impact of the third package of our transport liberalization measures and, in particular, I wish to thank Mr Seal for the work he has done on this communication.
</p>
<p class="contents">I accept that some progress has been made but I would point out to the Commissioner that there is still no level playing field and the market remains distorted. The British Presidency of the Transport Council talks of a people's Europe. So perhaps within this people's Europe we could see a stop to state aids now to ensure that there is a level playing field and fair competition between the carriers.
</p>
<p class="contents">In their reports both Mr Seal and Mr Sindal have referred to the problems of slots, and it is recognized that generally the overall capacity of slots both in the air and at airports is a problem. I would make a plea to the Commissioner tonight on the question of new entrants. While I personally accept the priority should be to encourage new airlines on existing routes, I would argue that where there is no new airline which wishes to compete, an existing airline should be allowed to operate a new route. Perhaps the Commissioner could consider that in the context of his slot‐allocation proposals.

(UPE).</span> – Mr President, I would like to welcome the Commissioner and to thank the rapporteur for his report. I wish also to state that I speak this evening on behalf of Mr Niall Andrews who wanted to speak on this subject but had to return to Dublin unexpectedly.
</p>
<p class="contents">The free movement of labour is one of the basic tenets on which the European Union relies and it is therefore up to us, the elected representatives of the European Union, to ensure that all our citizens have assess to affordable and speedy transport between the Member States of the Union. Airport charges play a pivotal role in allowing airlines the financial scope to offer customers low cost travel. The issue is one of particular importance to Ireland, as it is the only island state in the Union and relies heavily on the availability of low cost airfares.
</p>
<p class="contents">Through the air transport liberalization programme the European Union has taken steps to create the climate necessary for airlines to offer competitively priced airfares to the citizens of Europe. The air transport liberalization programme, which culminated in full liberalization of the market in 1997, has undoubtedly brought many benefits to consumers both in terms of access and cost. However, a commercially successful Irish airline competing in the European market, Ryanair, is currently engaged in a protracted trade dispute with its employees arising from the company's refusal to recognize or negotiate with the trade union chosen by some of the employees to represent them or to cooperate with the national industrial conciliation procedures which have been established to resolve such disputes.
</p>
<p class="contents">Ryanair, whose owners and senior managers had been very substantial financial beneficiaries of air transport liberalization, must immediately enter into dialogue with these employees who seek to be represented by a trade union of their choice and to utilize the resources of the national procedures that exist. I am concerned that this employer's behaviour may be symptomatic of a wider problem whereby the rights of vulnerable groups of employees are being abused in the aftermath of market liberalization and in the absence of adequate corresponding enforceable social protection. Could I call on the Commission to conclude and publish as a matter of urgency its promised assessment of the social impact of liberalization of the air transport sector, including the right to free negotiation, free association and collective bargaining.

(ELDR).</span> – Mr President, it is a pity that the rapporteur has sung his own praises because otherwise I would have done so and coming from me that would have been even more exceptional. However, I have to say that his report is excellent, even if in his contribution tonight he possibly concentrates a bit too much on the social consequences given that aircraft crews and pilots are among the best paid workers in the world.
</p>
<p class="contents"><span class="italic">
<span class="italic">
(NL)</span> Mr President, I would like to draw the Commissioner"s attention to a few things which to my mind require some improvements in this sector.</span></p>
<p class="contents">Firstly, there is the issue of state aid. I recall the discussion Mr Kinnock had with us in the Committee on Transport and Tourism when he took office, and in which he promised emphatically – I would almost say, with his hand on his heart – to put an end to state aid. Well, Mr President, state support is still continuing, and I want to state this emphatically, unfair competition in particular is perpetrated by companies such as Iberia, which allows its subsidiary Viva Air to work below cost price, and in doing so makes the market situation almost impossible for all sorts of other commercially operating companies and companies operating without government support.
</p>
<p class="contents">It should also be said that Air France, time and time again, cannot resist making life very difficult for new entrants onto the market in France. But on that, at least, the Commission took some action.
</p>
<p class="contents">Secondly – and I here I would like to ask the attention of the Commissioner"s staff, who are excellent, incidentally, because I would like a reply to my question if not during the next few days, then in writing if necessary – I am being told that in Italy the use of the seventh freedom, ‐ I am not talking about cabotage, that is going reasonably well – the transport of a Community company to a third country, is alleged to be impossible. This is because the Italians are demanding that this should only be an option when a company is established formally and legally in Italy, and not only has a company there, but also permanent equipment, in other words, aircraft and staff. This contravenes what is being requested in the seventh freedom. If we have to meet these kinds of conditions, we would rather grant the transport to companies from third countries, such as Egypt and Senegal, for instance.
</p>
<p class="contents">Mr President, I would like to raise a last point, and this concerns airports. I believe that if in Europe we are going to have competition in the aviation sector under the kind of circumstances we have at the moment, and in particular the environmental circumstances, where there are no common standards on noise levels on and around airports; companies start to compete with each other at the expense of the people because certain airports can take on extra passengers, because they ignore environmental and noise standards, while others do not. I would also like see to some harmonization in this area in Europe.
</p>
<p class="contents">Mr President, I have one final point. I would ask the Commission to pay more attention in its competition policy to networks rather than to specific lines.

<span class="italic">
(FR)</span> Mr President, the report by Mr Seal provides a qualified account of the liberalization of air transport, which has meant restructuring, mergers and privatizations, without the user drawing any real benefits from it. On the contrary, deregulation has had serious social repercussions with thousands of job losses, a decrease in security, decreases in salary and attacks on the status of staff. So I can only support the call in Mr Seal"s report inviting the Commission to publish the study on the consequences of liberalization on employment and the social field.
</p>
<p class="contents">It is obscene to devote only nine lines to this subject as the Commission has done. In the air transport sector, as elsewhere, the criteria of financial viability and its corollary of reduction in costs, lead to solutions which are often limited and do not ensure the best conditions, either for equality of access for all, the essential issue of security or for town and country planning. So we must take care that the imbalances concerning the peripheral and island regions in the Community do not increase.
</p>
<p class="contents">In a context which is subject to strong competitive pressure, notably from the United States, the European Union should aim to give priority to cooperation in joint developments, rather than using the logic of economic warfare. In this context, I welcome the fact that the two amendments from my group have been taken into account: one calls for bilateral agreements to be founded on real reciprocity, and the other draws attention to delocalization and social dumping. At a more basic level, I believe that we need a different dynamic in air transport, based on public management of this sector, in order to promote mutually advantageous cooperation, to encourage balanced national and regional development, to develop social rights and employment, to lift the restrictions on unions, in short, to guarantee everyone"s right to transport provided in good conditions.
</p>
<p class="contents">In order to promote democracy and transparency, an organization should be set up to facilitate public dialogue and to enable all the social players to participate in the orientation of and decisions concerning this sector. This is the line taken in the amendments we have tabled.

<span class="italic">
(NL)</span> Mr President, we would like to place the environmental considerations at the heart of the European Union"s decision‐making process. Integrating environmental issues into all policy areas of the European Union will be a major task, but one that we have to face. We believe we can deliver a more sustainable transport policy, and we are all agreed that it is essential to cut CO
<span class="sub">
2 </span>emissions from transport, which are growing faster than in any other sector. This is of course the Green group droning on about the environment again, is it not?
</p>
<p class="contents">The Committee on Transport and Tourism is quite happy to integrate the environment into transport policy, as is rapporteur Seal. But let me tell you, Mr Seal, that I did not make up my first four lines: they were spoken yesterday by your fellow party member Mr Prescott, who was here as President‐in‐Office of the Council, and he mentioned transport and the environment as the most important environmental issue of the British Presidency. But you, on the other hand, Mr Seal, do not manage to mention the word environment even once in your report. You, who blame the Commission for devoting a mere nine lines to employment, seem to have quite a blind spot when it comes to the environment. And let no one claim that air transport liberalization and increase in pollution from aeroplanes are not related.
</p>
<p class="contents">Competition has made flying cheaper, and Mr Seal points this out in his explanatory statement. That is nice for travellers, but bad news for the descendants of the travellers, because cheap tickets lead to more passenger kilometres and that leads to more pollution.
</p>
<p class="contents">The resolution predicts an annual increase in air traffic of 6 or 7 %. If we assume optimistically that half of this growth can be absorbed by technological progress, then we are still left with an increase in CO
<span class="sub">
2 </span>emissions from aeroplanes of at least 3 % a year. Did we not agree in Kyoto that CO
<span class="sub">
2 </span>emissions should come down, and that aviation should do its bit towards this? Clearly this all remained in Japanese to Mr Seal and my colleagues on the Committee on Transport and Tourism. I would like the Commission to tell us whether it has proposals to reduce CO
<span class="sub">
2 </span>emissions from aviation. And, by the way, how are the studies on kerosene tax and other levies progressing? Are environmental agreements part of the additional measures which, according to page 22 of the Commission"s statement, are missing in the present aviation agreements between the Member States and the US? Will the Commission ask the Council for a mandate to negotiate with the US not only about open skys, but also about cleaner skies? I would also like to know if the subject of aviation and the environment is on the agenda of the next two Environment and Transport Councils. If not, then I will have to conclude that although we may be trying the tame the car, the aeroplane has become Europe"s holy cow.

(I‐EDN).</span> – 
<span class="italic">
(NL)</span> Mr President, on 1 April 1997, liberalization of the internal market for civil aviation was completed – at least on paper. This occurred without as much as a whimper, so that the Dutch press spoke of a ‚whispered Big Bang". No cutting competition broke out between the big carriers, and ticket prices did not drop dramatically. Still, the structure of the aviation market in Europe has altered fundamentally over the past ten years. In the European Union market the large airlines are regrouping. A number of associations have grown modestly, and the market has become more dynamic. This is evident from the emergence of low‐budget companies, amongst other things. Tickets on routes where there is competition have now also become cheaper.
</p>
<p class="contents">The fact that liberalization passed off peacefully is also the result of the spectacular growth aviation has sadly undergone over the past few years. This meant that there were no large scale job losses, despite a constant drive for more efficiency.
</p>
<p class="contents">The Commission"s report deals primarily with efficiency and competition in aviation. The Commission rightly states that substantial savings can be made in groundhandling and air traffic control. But I believe that in future fair competition between different modes of transports must be looked at. Compared to passenger transport by rail or bus, aviation is still subsidized in disguise through duty‐free sales and cheap kerosene. I think it is right that duty‐free sales are soon to be abolished for flights within the European Union, but more efforts are needed as regards fair competition between different means of transport modes. That is why the introduction of a tax on kerosene within the Union is urgently required. Tax‐free kerosene in an internal market, with apologies to the interpreters, is truly “swan mad’.

(PSE).</span> – 
<span class="italic">
(IT)</span> Mr President, Commissioner, I too would like to thank the rapporteur for his work. I believe that the report enables us to give a sound opinion on liberalization and to deal with the relevant subjects specifically.
</p>
<p class="contents">I would like to point out several aspects I believe to be important. It was said that numerous companies have entered the market, remaining there without being competitive. In actual fact, many have not survived. Although, from an economic point of view, this may be considered negative, from the point of view of security it may be considered positive. Liberalization has not completely shattered the security and social guarantee mechanisms.
</p>
<p class="contents">However, there are contradictions and problems, particularly as regards working hours, the relocation of companies – which can have a negative effect on human resources from third countries –, and the management of services with agencies outside the EU which we naturally have to monitor carefully.
</p>
<p class="contents">In effect, the system has had positive results. I am convinced that we should take into account the reorganization process begun by the national companies. This reorganization process has been favourable and has made it possible to face the competition specifically, even leading some to highly innovative ideas, such as the company Alitalia, whose operators and workers are personally committed to the company management and also take part in company activities. These are highly important and significant aspects. State aid has made this reorganization process possible. I believe that proper aid has been provided and that they now possess a market opening and the ability to withstand the competition.
</p>
<p class="contents">However, I would like to deal with another aspect that needs to be highlighted. In some ways, competition has been more focused on the ground services and airport services than on the specific system of airline liberalization. It has to be admitted that we still have major problems as regards the airlines: I am not convinced we need to continue in the same way, for example in relations with the USA. The 
<span class="italic">
open sky</span> treaties should continue far more specifically because we need to extend the reorganization of the European airlines to the global market, to include therefore the competition within the American market, which we are prevented from doing at the moment. I believe that provides a strong limitation to the mechanisms of international competition.
</p>
<p class="contents">That is why the liberalization of the open sky systems and the ability to liberalize air space are important. We are faced with an air space that is strongly conditioned by the military systems, even today. Unfortunately, nowadays, we are still talking of war and the obstacles it might establish – I am referring to Iraq, of course. We will still have a complete violation of air space available. This is a dramatic point. It would be advisable for air space for the civilian system to be increasingly more available.
</p>
<p class="contents">The aspect of air traffic control has also been pointed out. We cannot go on like this any longer! It is possible to make marked savings and establish strong coordination in the control sector.
</p>
<p class="contents">To conclude, Commissioner, I am in favour of the measures and I believe that the next action relating to airport duties will provide us with further capacity to face the market and to support the social mechanisms providing guarantees for workers.

<span class="italic">
(SV)</span> Mr President, the liberalization of the aviation industry has been taking place for decades. It is a positive and necessary development to satisfy the desire of a growing number of passengers. In the assessment now being made, the Commission does not see any dramatic changes in the development after liberalization. That means that the large airlines still remain and that foreign competitors have not ousted domestic operators to any large degree; nor have there been any dramatic price reductions.
</p>
<p class="contents">Clearly, if that is what we want to bring about through liberalization, we can say we have succeeded. But if prices have not been reduced and accessibility for passengers has not increased, I am drawn to the conclusion that liberalization needs to be taken further. There is a need for more competition and more operators in the European air transport market, not fewer. Today there are far too few airlines dominating far too many routes, and these airlines are constantly entering into increasingly sophisticated cooperation agreements. In practice, this continues to disable competition in the air transport market.
</p>
<p class="contents">I am convinced that the necessary development has only just begun. Satisfying the passengers' demands calls for increased accessibility and lower prices. We need to open up to competition and create the conditions for substantially more players than there are today in this sector. Together this will enable the development which will allow us to satisfy passengers' demands by the year 2000.

<span class="italic">
(SV)</span> Mr President, unlike Mr Stenmarck, I do not have the same faith in the possibilities of liberalization with regard to airlines and air transport. I think there is considerable over‐confidence in what can be achieved through deregulation of air transport.
</p>
<p class="contents">Swedish domestic air services have been open to competition for a number of years, and this initially led to much price competition. However, today we have a quite different situation. There are sometimes two airlines on the most attractive routes, but these usually compete with the same timetables, the same prices and roughly the same service too. On the less attractive routes, however, there are higher prices and poorer services, and this strengthens the regional differences which were already considerable. Unfortunately, this is all happening in a country which is highly dependent on domestic air transport since there are often no alternatives.
</p>
<p class="contents">I also think it is important to ensure that an increase in air transport is not a goal in itself. It is in fact environmentally unsustainable to maintain the rate of growth which we have today.
</p>
<p class="contents">I have proposed a special amendment, Amendment No 3, which is based on the idea that competition must take place through socially acceptable methods. I have made particular reference to the Irish airline Ryanair, which has distinguished itself through its anti‐union policies. The airline refuses to enter into agreements with unions, and this has led to a conflict which is currently taking place with baggage handlers at Dublin airport. The airline has refused to cooperate with the Irish Labour Court. I think it is quite unacceptable to employ such methods in competition between airlines. We must show that we do not accept anti‐union attitudes or social dumping as a means of competition. It would be interesting to hear whether the Commissioner has any views on Ryanair's behaviour.
</p>
<p class="contents">Against this background I would like to say I support the GUE/NGL group's amendment as well as that of the Green group.

Mr Seal's report highly recommends many of the positive aspects of the aviation industry in recent years. Among the blessed, he mentions Ryanair, now the most profitable airline in Europe, more profitable as a percentage of turnover than the giant BA.
</p>
<p class="contents">As several previous speakers have mentioned, they have been locked in dispute on what many of us would regard as one of the basic human rights, that of the workers to join a trade union and be represented by a trade union. These workers were willing to work for considerably below the going rate when the airline started, recognising that the company could not afford the higher wages at the time. This is an airline that has made £IRL 35 million profit in the last year. Their chief executive recently earned a personal bonus of £IRL 17 million. Another company much smaller, much bigger are paying considerably higher wages than Ryanair. Let us not hand out kudos to a company whose industrial relations practices are unjust and whose profits are built on the generosity of their employees.</p>

<span class="italic">
Member of the Commission</span>. – This has been a very interesting debate. I should like, first of all, to thank the rapporteur, Mr Seal, for his account of the evolution of aviation liberalization in the European Union. Producing a fair assessment of a new and ongoing process is always likely to be a testing experience. I compliment him on the approach that he has taken.</p>
<p class="contents">As the House will know, civil aviation liberalization in the Union has been an intentionally progressive process, partly in order to take account of the conditions from which it started in the mid−1980s, and partly to avoid disruptions and losses of the kind which liberalization produced in the United States of America. In other words, it has been and is what Mr Seal is seeking: a balanced liberalization that has taken some pains to try to ensure that the interests of all legitimate concerns are taken into account.
</p>
<p class="contents">It is inevitable that while some of the main effects of liberalization were identified in our 1996 communication, others have only become clearly apparent since, as airlines have increasingly taken advantage of the possibilities offered. As we acknowledged in 1996, much remained to be done to ensure that the potential created by liberalization was fulfilled and fair competition conditions were achieved. That is certainly true of state aid. As the House will know, in the Commission's view, aid to airlines from Member State governments can only be justified, and must only be authorized, as an integral part of a consistent and timelimited programme to restore the financial viability and competitiveness of the recipient companies.
</p>
<p class="contents">I am certain that this approach has directly contributed to making the restructuring programmes credible and successful. I noticed Iberia's results in 
<span class="italic">
The Financial Times</span> this morning and took some satisfaction from that. Our careful monitoring of the implementation of restructuring plans and the way in which they comply with the conditions laid down shows the productive results that are being achieved. It was on that basis that we were able to authorize final payment by the French and Portuguese governments to Air France and to TAP. Regrettably, it is also on that basis that we had to conclude that Olympic Airways was not complying with the essential conditions set out at the time of the agreement with the Greek Government in 1994. We consequently had to reopen the procedure on that case.
</p>
<p class="contents">In recent weeks we also had to take a very strict attitude towards the Italian Government and Alitalia who were in breach of basic conditions that were included in the Commission's state aid decision of last July. I am glad to say that we received a swift and effective response from the Italian Cabinet and, within a few days, further and binding undertakings were given which resolved the issues.
</p>
<p class="contents">On the other issues that I have listened to, in the claims made during the course of the debate, and relating to state aid in competitive conditions, I must say that if honourable Members have evidence upon which complaints can authoritatively be made, they are doing the complainants no service if they do not encourage them to make the appropriate complaint to the European Commission. I can say this: we respond with speed to all substantive complaints. The recent experience in the case of Alitalia is a further demonstration of that. If Members believe, therefore, that they have heard of complaints that have not been notified to us, they should say so; not to us, but to those who have voiced concerns to them.
</p>
<p class="contents">On the issue of globalization, we are now turning our efforts to ensuring that the consolidation of the market does not produce adverse and counterproductive effects. The rapporteur identifies the multiplication of mergers as being part of the globalization trend. It is worth noting, however, that because of the restrictive clauses on ownership and control in most existing bilateral agreements, mergers are practically impossible, and that is why we are witnessing a proliferation of airline alliances instead.
</p>
<p class="contents">The diversity and the disparity of regulatory regimes clearly inhibits the effective operation of the market and that, of course, is a major reason for the Commission's efforts to gain a negotiating mandate on market‐access agreements with third countries, particularly the United States of America. It is obvious that if the Community does not take the opportunity to negotiate a comprehensive air‐service agreement with the USA, United States Airlines will, by design or default, be disproportionate beneficiaries of 
<span class="italic">
our</span> single market, of 
<span class="italic">
our</span> liberalization, when our airlines have no effective comparable rights of access and operation to the United States' single market. I hope, therefore, that Member States of every kind will heed the reality and respond with alacrity to the challenge so that we can get on as a Community with negotiating a fair and balanced open‐skies agreement across the Atlantic and on both sides of it. It would be extremely alarming if, by the cumulative effect of current bilateral agreements and future bilateral agreements, United States Airlines were effectively able to operate at will in our single market when there was absolutely no reciprocation to speak of in the United States' single market.
</p>
<p class="contents">Meanwhile, as the House will know, we opened investigations into three existing transatlantic airline alliances and into one proposed alliance in 1996. Far from having adopted a dilatory attitude, as the rapporteur appeared to suggest in his report, the Commission has been very vigilant about the developments in a market which, by becoming global, could, in turn, create fresh constraints on the full benefits of liberalization. Recognition of that has, for instance, prompted the Commission to take initiatives on air‐traffic management – which was mentioned by some honourable Members –, on groundhandling services – mentioned by other honourable Members – and on airport challenges – again referred to by some contributors to the debate. Our proposal for the revision of the current airport slots regulation will become public within the next few months.
</p>
<p class="contents">Mr Seal is right to point out that our communication did not devote much space to the social aspects of liberalization. Although it would also be true to say that the Commission has in other respects been particularly attentive to the social impact of liberalization measures. The House is aware – and there were references to this – that we commissioned a study to address this issue. And since we received the results of that study within the last week, I can firmly express the hope that the final report will be available to this Parliament and to the general public in April.
</p>
<p class="contents">It is already clear, of course, that civil aviation has been the only transport mode in which employment increased between 1990 and 1995, and although the total growth was modest – about 0.4 % per annum over the period – it is worth noting that was achieved despite general economic recession and despite extensive airline restructuring, which has, in some cases, caused what turns out to be a temporary reduction in staff. The increased effectiveness and competitiveness of airlines has the effect, of course, of again stimulating demand for employment – and that is good news for everybody.
</p>
<p class="contents">As the House might anticipate, I totally agree with Mr Seal's view that liberalization should not, indeed must not, be achieved at the expense of safety, and we will therefore continue to be active and vigilant on safety issues, not only at Community level but globally. To give practical evidence of that: we have in recent months proposed a directive to establish safety assessment of thirdcountry aircraft operating in the European Union, and we have published our proposal for the establishment of a European civil aviation safety agency. In addition, outside the Community the Commission makes sustained efforts to secure and to maintain the effective implementation of ICAO standards. Meanwhile we are also addressing environmental aviation issues, which were referred to by some of the contributors to the debate, through the communication on carbon dioxide emissions and transport which we shall be publishing in the spring and, in addition, more specifically in our study on the implication of the impositions of a kerosene tax for civil aviation and the environment. The House may know that we have for the first time joint environment and transport councils convened under the United Kingdom Presidency – one informal, one formal – and we look forward to very positive results for transport and environment from those initiatives.
</p>
<p class="contents">As far as the protection of consumers is concerned, the Commission has recently presented a proposal concerning denied‐boarding compensation, whilst the current code of conduct on computerized reservation systems, as well as the amendments proposed to it, already provides for the operator of a flight to be clearly identified and for the passenger to be properly informed. We have had some passenger complaints on this issue and I hope that honourable Members, as frequent flyers themselves, and as users of liberalized air services, will take pains to ensure that if they experience difficulties in this respect, they communicate those difficulties both to the airlines concerned and send a copy to me. I would be pleased to have such information from the front line. I will certainly act upon it.
</p>
<p class="contents">These actions, in so far as consumers are concerned, should reinforce the requirements of information and transparency that Mr Seal's report is rightly seeking. The list of different actions, which I have given this evening, is not exhaustive but it shows clearly that the Commission does not consider that its work was completed when we presented our communication in October 1996 or when the single market in civil aviation was formally and legally completed on the 1 April last year. On the contrary, we acknowledged that further work was necessary and since then we have been actively pursuing further necessary advances. Against that background, Mr Seal's report is of great help in emphasizing priorities and in highlighting the significance of the social dimension. He will, I hope, be pleased to know therefore that in order to give full attention to the social impact, and also to take account of new developments and the changing environment in which airlines operate after the full completion of the aviation single market, we will be publishing the report that I referred to earlier which should be available for debate in this Parliament in the near future. I hope that I can say with complete confidence that the report will provide a full response to those aspects of Mr Seal's report which relate to the matters that were not dealt with by our previous communication. I look forward to considering that and indeed other matters with this House but hopefully not at such great length in future.

(PPE), </span>
<span class="italic">
rapporteur. – (DE)</span> Mr President, Commissioner, ladies and gentlemen, the safety training of cabin crews in civil aviation is almost a component of the subject which we have just discussed, or a consequence of it. The Commission could in this respect have taken the terms of the JAA changed or unchanged and transferred them into Community law – quite simply in accordance with Regulation No 3922/91. It has, however, chosen another route, namely the form of a directive.
</p>
<p class="contents">It is of course clear that we as Parliamentarians explicitly welcome this decision, and the fact that we as a parliament are involved in the lawmaking process. But in my view that is not the most important reason point. The Commission"s proposal – and this is the most important element – puts the work of the cabin crews in the correct light, that is, it covers their safety functions. It is very important therefore to provide more transparency in terms of the fact that the crews must undergo basic training, a general further training and additional training related to various types of aeroplane. That is, in our view, an important part of this work. There is in fact a risk, which has just been discussed, that the airlines in the thick of the competition battle will regard these very training costs as variable costs and correspondingly perhaps try to economize in this area, which in my opinion would be unfortunate.
</p>
<p class="contents">Therefore, we also see the programmes proposed in the Annex as minimum requirements. In our opinion, both the basic training and the type‐training indicated should form part of basic training, in which really nothing may be left out. This would mean that the cabin crew enjoy the social protection which exists in every similar profession, and that entry to the profession or employment in this job is no longer possible without training. If we compare the programmes of one airline with another then we soon discover that this directive is necessary. Although most airlines take training very seriously, the further training, particularly the typetraining is somehow neglected.
</p>
<p class="contents">The Commission"s proposal also respects subsidiarity. It therefore takes into account the desire of Member States to continue to define their training themselves, although there should be an obligation to keep the Commission informed.
</p>
<p class="contents">In short, the proposal is an ideal response to technical and administrative questions, to social challenges in the free market and to safety claims associated with the profession of cabin crew. Although it is not as important, we must not forget in this document that with some form of recognition – here known as certification – mobility in this professional sphere can be increased. The amendments submitted by the Committee on Transport and Tourism in this respect are therefore to be regarded as no more than fine tuning. They regulate amongst other things transfer conditions, they regulate or fix the obligation of the Member States to supply information and they regulate medical monitoring somewhat more clearly. In the Commission"s proposals only regular checks are suggested: we however propose a periodic cycle of inspections.
</p>
<p class="contents">The amendments tabled later by Mr Simpson are in my view also worthy of support. Although the Commission"s text, my amendments, and the amendments proposed in committee maintained the distinction between cabin crew with and without safety functions, these amendments from Mr Simpson are designed to remove this distinction, so that all cabin crew must meet the same training requirements. In my opinion, this has the important advantage of ensuring that there will no longer be cabin crew with varying qualifications and that in serious situations any member of the cabin crew will be able to fulfil his task completely.
</p>
<p class="contents">Finally I would like to remind my colleagues – and perhaps that could have been said from the start, for thus far the whole thing sounds rather unanimous – that this directive is of course not welcomed by the JAA and the airlines. For me this is not yet particularly worrying. I am far more concerned about the scepticism – to put it mildly – of the Council on this subject. I hope that even those accidents which have been avoided, to say nothing about the tragic reality of the actual aircraft accidents, will convince the Council, so that this document does not end up in a drawer somewhere but is instead dealt with effectively and also fulfils its objective.

<span class="bold">
(PSE).</span> – Mr President, first of all, just to clarify: we are tonight debating safety standards for cabin crew and not air traffic controllers. At least I hope so. I know it is very late but I believe that is the directive we are discussing, otherwise I am in the wrong room. I think we have a problem with interpretation, with all due respect to Mr Grosch.
</p>
<p class="contents">I wish to thank him for his efforts in endeavouring to steer this report through Parliament and doing such a comprehensive job, and also to congratulate the Commission on having the foresight to bring this forward, particularly in the light of what we have just been saying about liberalization and the very important comments the Commissioner made about the need to underpin liberalization with a very strong social framework. This is clear evidence that is actually happening, and this is a measure which commands the full support of the Group of the Party of European Socialists.
</p>
<p class="contents">One point we have to stress is that we need to get over to the Council and, indeed, the wider community why this measure is so important. One thing we have to make very clear is that, contrary to accepted beliefs, if you are involved in an air crash the likelihood is that you will not actually die. Indeed, many aircraft accidents are survivable. Around 75 % of aircraft are involved in accidents during approach, landing or take‐off. Research indicates that around 90 % of all aircraft accidents could be survivable. It is estimated that of the 1 500 people on average who die each year, some 300 a year, on average, could survive if evacuation measures within aircraft were improved. I am confident that if we had better, faster and more effective evacuation, we could save lives – as many as 300 a year.
</p>
<p class="contents">How do we do that? There are a number of methods by which we can improve evacuation measures. Firstly by the behaviour and crowd‐control skills of cabin crew during emergency evacuations, and, secondly, by passengers' knowledge of safety procedures and their motivation to get acquainted with them. We all know from our experience in flying that no‐one takes any notice whatsoever of cabin crew when they are giving us the safety demonstrations and yet all the evidence suggests that information they are conveying to us could make the difference between life or death. There are a number of reasons why evacuation is a key issue, and training is clearly a means by which we can enable and motivate the cabin crew to provide effective information to the passengers, before, during and after an incident. That is why we believe this measure is so important.
</p>
<p class="contents">The large majority of air crashes are survivable technically, and effective evacuation is so important. Current regulations, for example, specify that an aircraft must be evacuated within 90 seconds with just half the exits open. In 1994 research was carried out by both the CAA and the FAA which clearly indicated that the difference between getting out of the aircraft or not depended on assertive, highly‐trained and highly‐effective cabin crew. Tonight we should reflect on that. It underpins the work of Mr Grosch and the proposal from the Commission. The results show clearly that trained cabin crew make the difference. That is the reason why we are very pleased to support this proposal for a directive on the training of cabin crew.
</p>
<p class="contents">We have a number of concerns which we have identified via our amendments. We think that in an incident you cannot differentiate between some cabin crew who may have safety training and others who do not. All the crew should have the skills necessary to ensure that the plane, for example, is evacuated as quickly and effectively as possible. That is why we have tabled Amendments Nos 9, 10, 11, 12, 14, 15, 16 and 17, to ensure this measure applies to all the cabin crew. If you speak to the cabin crew themselves, they do not want to create a situation where, possibly, some airline operators could differentiate between cabin crew and create a two‐tier system.
</p>
<p class="contents">In Amendment No 13 we propose annual medical checks for cabin crew. Again we think this is perfectly reasonable, when your life is effectively in not just the pilot's hands but also in the hands of the cabin crews. An annual medical check is the best way forward. Leaving it just to the wording ‚regular’ is not sufficient.
</p>
<p class="contents">Finally, Amendment No 18 talks about annual training for cabin crews, including things like fire‐fighting and the use of life rafts. Again, it is extraordinary that a basic requirement like using fire‐fighting equipment or life rafts is not checked annually. That is why we are tabling this amendment, to ensure that training is given on an annual basis.
</p>
<p class="contents">In conclusion, as travel demand increases, the number of aircraft increase, the number of risks increase, it is vital that safety standards throughout the Community are harmonized. We believe this directive will ensure that and could make the difference between life and death itself.

(PPE).</span> – 
<span class="italic">
(SV)</span> Mr President, let me begin by thanking Mr Grosch, on behalf of the PPE group, for a thorough piece of work. This is a very important report. Setting safety requirements is one of the most important tasks for all of us who are concerned with questions of transport at European level. With the deregulation and liberalization of air transport, it is essential that safety should not suffer.
</p>
<p class="contents">We know today that safety rules vary greatly from one EU country to another. The JAA, the Joint Aviation Authority, has concentrated on this and approved common requirements both for basic training and for further training. This is all of the utmost importance, and the more players operating in an increasingly liberalized air transport market in future, the more important it will become. I am quite convinced that there really will be more players operating in this market. In this context, one of our biggest and most important tasks is to help ensure that safety requirements are increased and not reduced. That is a precondition for liberalization to have a real and lasting impact.
</p>
<p class="contents">In this context, I do not want to make a big thing of the issue of certification at European level. But it is worth giving encouragement to cabin crews, who are a group of employees who work across borders to a very large extent, so that they also have the possibility of changing jobs to another airline in the EU. This could happen in various ways, such as through a licence of this kind. But I think it seems extraordinarily important to encourage this.
</p>

(I‐EDN).</span> – 
<span class="italic">
(NL)</span> Mr President, Commissioner, the completion of the internal market for civil aviation has increased the need for international agreements on safety standards for European Union countries. Increased competition sadly only increases the temptation to cut down on safety. The proposal on safety requirements for cabin crews has been prepared and accepted within the Joint Aviation Authority to which eighteen European countries belong.
</p>
<p class="contents">The Commission believes it should add to the JAA proposal a competence certificate for cabin crews. Recognition of training in one Member State by aviation authorities in other Union Member States was meant to improve the mobility of cockpit crews. This concession to the unions ignores the reality that all airlines have different safety procedures which even differ between aircrafts within each airline. That is why, to my mind, such a certificate will not promote staff mobility, whilst the Member States are burdened with an extra administrative commitment.
</p>
<p class="contents">Moreover, the addition of safety certificates has made the Council proposal controversial. It looks unlikely that this will be discussed within the near future. For these reasons it would have been better if the Commission had limited itself to the JAA proposal.
</p>
<p class="contents">We have a similar objection to the amendments tabled by the Group of the Party of European Socialists. They claim that every crew member is responsible for safety duties, and should therefore receive training. I believe that it is possible to maintain a proper level of safety on aeroplanes without seeing all members of the crew as safety personnel. I will therefore not be able to support the PSE amendments. I support Mr Grosch"s amendments which clarify the proposal where the Commission text is too vague.
</p>

<span class="bold">
(PSE).</span> – Mr President, firstly we all know national provisions on safety training for cabin crew vary widely across the European Union. With the liberalization of the whole air transport sector, it is imperative that we have common standards on training and licensing of cabin crews throughout the Union. As you have heard earlier, in Ireland we have the situation where Ryanair baggage handlers are on strike simply because they want to be represented by a trade union. They are low paid with poor working conditions and their legitimate demand is that they be represented professionally with regard to pay and health and safety conditions.
</p>
<p class="contents">Serious questions have to be asked about the operation procedures and indeed the training provided by low cost airlines such as Ryanair, Translift and others. I am also very concerned about reports on the hours that these cabin crew work and the consequent fatigue they suffer with no breaks allowed between shifts and 25 minute turnaround time during which they are required to carry out cleaning duties. Cutthroat competition in the air seems to be leading to a lowering of safety standards and we have seen a lot of accidents recently which I know will be investigated and we will see what turns up.
</p>
<p class="contents">The latest media reports that airlines are reducing fuel costs by recycling unfiltered air into passenger cabins are equally alarming for all of us who travel frequently and, more particularly, for the cabin staff and pilots. Cabin crew are the only safety professionals with dual responsibilities. While safety is their primary responsibility, they are mainly engaged in other tasks. Safety refresher courses must take place on an annual basis.
</p>
<p class="contents">Finally I would ask this particular question: is it because the vast majority of cabin crew are women that licensing was not introduced a long time ago?
</p>

<span class="bold">
(PPE).</span> – Mr President, this proposal is obviously linked to the measures to support the process of liberalization in the air transport sector with the aim of ensuring high safety standards. I congratulate the rapporteur for his excellent work, and the Commission for its excellent proposal.
</p>
<p class="contents">My concern with the directive proposed is, will it actually improve safety in air transport? Our aim should surely be to set the best safety practices across Europe. Currently, the joint aviation authorities seek to achieve cabin crew safety by placing responsibility for safety throughout an airline clearly on the operator. Currently that operator must ensure comprehensive safety throughout the company and that cabin crew are trained to fit in with that company's specific system. The directive waters down this responsibility and, therefore, may just possibly undermine cabin crew safety.
</p>
<p class="contents">The Commissioner, this evening, referred to a number of proposals, including that to set up the European Civil Aviation Safety Agency and efforts to improve the implementation of ICAO standards throughout the European Union. I would make a plea to the Commission this evening to reach an early agreement with the Council on the setting‐up of this European Civil Aviation Safety Agency to ensure that safety both in Europe and worldwide is secured.
</p>
<p class="contents">The figures show – and were discussed in a conference in Maastricht today – that over the last ten years 70 % of all accidents have involved carriers accounting for only 16 % of total air traffic. Those airlines from developing countries appear to be mostly at risk. Without this European action which is so urgently required, experts predict that quite possibly there could be one air accident a week.
</p>
<p class="contents">So please, Commissioner, and the British Presidency of the Transport Council, act now. We must set up this European air transport safety organization with proper safety checks at all European airports to ensure the safety of those European passengers using those carriers and those European residents near Community airports receiving them.
</p>
<p class="contents">I am delighted to support this report. But I hope that the Commissioner can satisfy me that urgent action will be taken by the Council of Ministers and through his good offices.</p>

Member of the Commission.</span> – First of all I would like to thank Mr Grosch and the Committee on Transport and Tourism for the work that they have put in to considering this particular proposal, and for the generally supportive attitude that they have taken.</p>
<p class="contents">In a growing and changing environment such as civil aviation, it is obviously essential that the highest possible safety standards are maintained. It is equally obvious that the people responsible for fulfilling those safety standards must be well‐trained and wellmotivated. The purpose of the proposal before the House is to achieve those outcomes. I know that honourable Members share that objective, as they have demonstrated again in the course of this debate.
</p>
<p class="contents">I should like to make two other points by way of introduction. First, this draft directive sets down minimum, not maximum standards. Our constant desire is that Member States will seek to exceed these minima, even though they are of a satisfactory level for the general purposes of maintaining the safety of aircraft and passengers.
</p>
<p class="contents">Secondly, just as a point of reassurance, but certainly not in any spirit of complacency, our region of the world sees 30 % of the world's air traffic movements, but only 10 % of air traffic accidents take place in this region. Everybody responsible works to try to ensure that the level of accidents is even lower than that. We strive for nil, naturally. But it is important to put the matter into perspective so that the general idea is not spread that somehow there is a deterioration in standards, inadvertent or deliberate.
</p>
<p class="contents">I would say to Miss McIntosh, for instance, that there is absolutely no conceivable way in which this draft proposal, inadvertently or deliberately, could possibly lead to the dilution of standards in air safety. I will deal with that point at greater length later on.
</p>
<p class="contents">I should also say to Mrs Malone, though unfortunately she has left the Chamber, probably on pressing business, that if she has evidence of an increase in accidents, as she claimed, I want to see it most urgently. Secondly, if there is evidence that any aircraft operating in European Union airspace has been recycling unfiltered air into the cabin, I want evidence of that too because we most certainly will make an active response.
</p>
<p class="contents">In response to the amendments proposed by Mr Grosch, Amendments Nos 4 and 5 add clarity to the text. The Commission can therefore accept them. I am also glad to say that the Commission shares the desire of the rapporteur to uphold the established rights of experienced cabin crew. We can therefore accept Amendment No 8.
</p>
<p class="contents">I understand the motivation behind Amendment No 1, but it appears to me to be somewhat superfluous since the content of the training programmes is laid down in the Annexes to the directive and will be universally applicable. To centralize each and every programme at Community‐level seems to me to be unnecessary.
</p>
<p class="contents">That problem of otiose bureaucracy also applies to Amendment No 6. As far as Amendment No 7 is concerned, I do not see what added value it gives. In practice, cabin crew automatically receive conversion training when changing from one aircraft type to another and the obligations for and the regulation of recurrent training are laid down in Article 5 and in the annexes to this directive.
</p>
<p class="contents">While I fully appreciate the rationale behind Amendment No 2 as well, it would, in practice, extend the provision of the directive to staff such as beauticians, secretaries and medical companions who are on‐board an aircraft for purely commercial reasons and have neither the training nor, in general, the competence to provide useful assistance in the event of an emergency in the air. In many respects they are effectively passengers themselves.
</p>
<p class="contents">I do not believe it was the intention of the rapporteur that this should be the case – that people should be allocated responsibilities for which they have not been professionally trained. This point applies equally to the series of amendments put by Mr Simpson: Amendments Nos 9‐12 and 14‐17, which have the same objective. I understand it to be laudable, but I cannot see how it can be practicable. So I cannot accept any of those amendments.
</p>
<p class="contents">The Commission cannot support Amendment No 3 either, nor the new Amendment No 13, which specify the regularity of medical checks. When legislating, we have to bear in mind the costs of our legislation and also have to recognize who will meet the bills. If the result of implementing the provision on medical checks appeared to be very costly, there would be resistance and that would undermine the very basis of the proposal. Decisions on precise frequency of checks are therefore best left to national authorities who, I am absolutely certain, will not let great gaps appear between medical checks of air crew of any description.
</p>
<p class="contents">There remains just one amendment, Amendment No 18, which, again, I regret to say I cannot accept. This amendment seeks to increase the required frequency of recurrent training and to so well beyond the requirements of JAR‐OPS from which our proposal originates. I would say to Miss McIntosh, when she considers that there is a possibility of reducing the level of requirements below that of the JAA, I would refer her to page 2 of the proposal. The common safety training standards, as laid down in JAROPS compare favourably with international recommended standards and the better training practices of industry. They are adequate to ensure a high level of safety. This proposal is entirely in conformity with that. Making a further change would add an unnecessary burden on operators without bringing any greater safety guarantees.
</p>
<p class="contents">In conclusion, I would like again to thank Parliament for its work. The adoption of this Commission proposal, with the amendments that I have indicated will, I am sure, contribute directly to maintaining motivation amongst staff and sustaining high levels of safety standards in civil aviation. I know that honourable Members, together with the Commission, strongly support both objectives.

(PSE).</span> – Mr President, if I can try be helpful to the Commissioner I accept his point about other auxiliary cabin staff, beauticians etc. But his own proposal, his own directive Article 2(b), with its definition of a cabin crew, already addresses this point. It actually specifies that it does not apply to crew members solely assigned to non‐safety duties. So the answer lies in your own text, Commissioner, I hope perhaps we can review this in that context.
</p>
<p class="contents">Secondly, on the point about annual health checks, I understand that all staff of the European institutions are required to have annual health checks. Surely if it is good enough for us and our institutions, it should be good enough for cabin crew members.

rapporteur. – (FR)</span> Mr President, ladies and gentlemen, I am attacking my first report. The proposal for a directive and the report which I submitted have as their objective the establishment of technical requirements applicable to motor vehicles and to trailers, guaranteeing transport by road.
</p>
<p class="contents">Certain requirements were already put in place by the 1994 directive regarding the construction of vehicles which transport hazardous goods by road. However, the recognition and acceptance by all Member States of the characteristics of construction of this type of vehicle is not guaranteed.
</p>
<p class="contents">This new directive sets down specific clauses for the construction of vehicles. It also provides the technical specifications for electrical equipment, braking systems, fire risks and speed limits. This harmonization has the advantage of preventing a Member State from prohibiting the sale, registration or entry into service of motor vehicles which have already been approved in other Member States.
</p>
<p class="contents">Only one amendment to this proposal has been tabled by the Committee on Transport and Tourism. It relates to fixing a date for the entry into force of the legislative, regulatory and administrative clauses necessary to conform to this directive. This deadline has been set for twelve months after the publication of the directive.
</p>
<p class="contents">No other amendment has been tabled and I think that this report does not represent any particular problem and, Mr President I think we have a broad consensus on this subject.
</p>

(PPE), </span>
<span class="italic">
rapporteur. – (ES)</span> Mr President, it is very clear that this proposal for a directive has been in the process of formulation, basically, to plug the two most blatant loopholes in the legislation referring to the manufacture, transport, commercialization, use and maintenance of all transportable pressure equipment which will fulfil the requirements of the ADR and RID agreements.
</p>
<p class="contents">Such agreements, as you know ladies and gentlemen, are intended to strengthen safety in the transport of such equipment and ensure free circulation of the same in the common Community market. At the same time an orderly transition is needed from current transportable pressure equipment to that of the future and this can be done through periodic inspections and conformity assessments following the modular approach, although the process requires inspection bodies to comply with adequate quality criteria, such as those based on the CEN standard in the EN 45000 series, since basing such criteria solely on the content of the directives concerned may not be sufficient, as both these directives deal almost exclusively with transport, with the result that there is a shortage of specific provisions on certain other matters.
</p>
<p class="contents">Finally, Mr President, ladies and gentlemen, it seems clear from recent experience that mutual recognition of inspections, which is essential for making progress towards completion of the internal market, can not be fully achieved, through the application of annexes A and B of the ADR directive, which only seems to ensure freedom of transport, and which, because it includes no provision for distinguishing marks, has little impact on the use of such equipment in the country of destination. Hence the need for the present directive.
</p>
<p class="contents">Consequently, one of the major advantages of this proposal is that products can secure a higher market share, with the inherent advantage of securing economies of scale and lower administrative costs for the relevant approvals. For this purpose, the equipment concerned must be easily identifiable and the best way of doing this is clearly to give them a distinctive mark different from those currently in force for stable pressure equipment or gas bottles.
</p>
<p class="contents">However, the main dilemma posed by this proposal concerns the question of experience as opposed to independence. I am referring, of course, to the inspection bodies. It is well known that for many years, the European industry has been able to carry out proper inspections on this equipment, including ADR class 2, by means of type B or even type C bodies belonging to the users' sector. This has been possible because they have been able to accumulate an advanced level of knowledge through daily contact with the problems concerned. They have therefore achieved a lot in the last few years.
</p>
<p class="contents">On the other hand, it may be that the experience because of their centralized nature, of type A bodies is confined to new products on the market, with the result that their experience and skills are more general.
</p>
<p class="contents">For these reasons, the Committee on Transport and Tourism unanimously approved this report and its corresponding motion for a resolution.

rapporteur. – (FR)</span>
<span class="bold">
</span>Mr President, this second report seeks to recognize two registration plates for vehicles and their trailers. There is a real legal vacuum in terms of recognition of registration plates by the Member States of the European Union. This proposal for a regulation from the Commission aims to overcome this.
</p>
<p class="contents">Several Member States are parties to the 1968 Vienna Convention which requires an oval sign composed of black letters on a white ground distinguishing the State in which the vehicle is registered. It may comprise no more than three letters on a white background and may not be incorporated in the number plate.
</p>
<p class="contents">The sign incorporated in the number plate (Community model) was developed in collaboration with national experts, <br/>following a European Parliament resolution of 1988 calling for the incorporation of the European flag in registration plates. It consists of twelve stars surrounding the letters of the country and several countries have introduced this indication in the left‐hand corner of the number plate. Moreover, some countries which ratified the Convention of Vienna do not recognize this Community sign, and through their police they report drivers of foreign vehicles which display it alone. So, thanks to this recognition of two types of distinctive registration plate, no more vehicles can be reported in future.
</p>
<p class="contents">I entirely agree with this proposal for the recognition of European registration plates, but I have to formally record one reservation. It is absolutely critical, for reasons of national sensitivity, that the country of registration be included on the registration plate. People need a point of reference, they need to identify themselves with one country, one nation. Before being European, we are all from a specific country, culture and tradition. So it is necessary that this national sentiment, of coming from one particular country is included on the registration plate, as it is going to be.
</p>
<p class="contents">Mr President, eight amendments to this report have been tabled. Three come from the Committee on Transport and Tourism and do not present any problem. They involve clarifying and simplifying the original texts and providing useful explanations.
</p>
<p class="contents">This is not the case, however, for the amendments from Brian Simpson, because here they seem to me to complicate and weigh down the proposal for a regulation and my report. In fact, this report is not about official recognition of all the different registration plates, but only the European one. Every vehicle driving in a foreign country will have to display either the registration plate of the country of origin, or the European registration plate. Of course, nothing will prevent the use of other distinctive regional or local signs on vehicles, but these will not have any legal significance.
</p>
<p class="contents">Nor can I accept the amendment from Mr Cornelissen and Mr Pronk, because I think its impact goes beyond the framework of this report and the legal framework of the European Union.

(PSE).</span> – Mr President, I support the Rachinel report and I must say that one of the hallmarks of this Commission has been its overriding concern for safety, especially on our roads. This directive is designed to enhance existing legislation in the motor vehicle sector by ensuring that the construction characteristics of vehicles carrying dangerous goods are harmonized throughout the whole Community.
</p>
<p class="contents">It will be welcomed, in my opinion, by the industry that one set of rules will apply across the EU for the design and construction of vehicles carrying dangerous goods. This is a necessary step to develop and enhance safety on our roads. We need technical provisions to ensure that dangerous goods are safeguarded during the time they are in transport. This means possibly adopting standards of electrical equipment, braking systems, fire risk prevention provisions, etcetera, just to name a few.
</p>
<p class="contents">All will help to create what I regard as a safer environment on our roads. Accidents have happened and accidents, of course, will continue to happen. Let us not allow dangerous goods, which would pollute and damage health, to be carried in vehicles which are not up to what the Commission regards, and what we regard, as the highest possible standards. Let us minimize the risk of horrific accidents on the roads where hazardous materials are involved. Let us make this applicable to the whole of the EU.
</p>
<p class="contents">Finally, just one last appeal regarding distinguishing signs. I hope that the Commission will give some account to the symbols that might highlight smaller nations like Wales.

(DE)</span> Mr President, Mr Commissioner, ladies and gentlemen, since all of us here are experts I shall, in view of the late hour make just two basic comments on the Le Rachinel report on the type‐approval of vehicles and on the report of my colleague, Camisón Asensio, on transportable pressure equipment.
</p>
<p class="contents">Firstly, it is clearly insanely difficult really to make a reality of the Single Market. It is technical and is getting more and more technical, but we shall not be able to get out of the work. Perhaps we shall one day manage to deal conclusively in committee with the kind of report which does not have particularly great political importance, if the Commission presents us with well‐prepared reports, so that we no longer have any need to argue about slots at this time of night.
</p>
<p class="contents">Secondly, it is nevertheless important for our colleagues in the committee to study these reports carefully themselves. Mr Le Rachinel was, as it were, in the fortunate position after careful checking to be able to say: I need only one amendment. And everybody agreed with him. Colleague Camisón had more difficulties. He had to deal with 28 amendments because on the important question of inspection, he had become involved in discussions with those in the industry who were directly affected and came to a different point of view. I am very grateful that he worked out this complicated point so well. But it is important that we bear in mind that both reports are not only reports for the Single Market, for more business and for more trade. Rather both reports, as the previous speaker has also said, are quite important for people"s safety on the roads and thus for the protection of the natural environment, since accidents which occur can not only kill and injure people, but accidents with dangerous goods can cause incalculable damage to nature, in the water and in the soil.
</p>
<p class="contents">Therefore, I thank you sincerely for these good reports. We shall take the trouble to study these reports carefully. I thank the two rapporteurs and we will await the opinion of the Commission. I hope that the Commission does not immediately discard 20 of Mr Camisón"s 28 amendments, but we shall wait and see.

<span class="italic">
(NL)</span> Mr President, the merits of the regulation concerning the distinguishing signs for motor vehicles is that they put an end to the practice of drivers being fined because one Member State does not recognize the distinguishing sign of another. The recognition of the registration plate comprising national registration and the European flag will obviously become increasingly important as more Member States start introducing this, and, perhaps, a Community registration number.
</p>
<p class="contents">The Dutch government, for instance, plans to include the European flag and the letters NL on the number plate. It might be possible, of course, that in a wave of Euroscepticism, the flag will be a disaster in the Netherlands. The European Parliament"s popularity, and by implication that of the European Union, is not exactly furthered by the kind of scenes which took place here yesterday and today during votes, when European Members of Parliament declared they were not being paid to vote. I wonder then what they are paid for.
</p>
<p class="contents">It bothers me very much that our European flag is allowed to grace vehicles which should not really drive on the European roads; cars without catalytic converters, for example. I would like to see Member States, mindful of the subsidiarity principle, be given the right to withhold the flag from the most polluting cars and engines: watch out, environmental pirate! Unfortunately, parliaments do not seem to understand my graphic amendments, which is why I was not able to submit them.

(PSE).</span> – Mr President, I will restrict myself this evening to Mr Le Rachinel"s report on vehicle registration signs and of course I congratulate him on his efforts in producing the report. There is clearly a need across Europe to clarify the situation, which is incredibly complicated for the average motorist trying to travel around the Continent, and indeed UK and Ireland as well. The signs referred to by Nel van Dijk which the Dutch may or may not adopt in the year 2000 are currently compulsory in Ireland and Portugal, they are optional in France and Germany, where they may make them compulsory, whilst all the other countries have the Vienna Convention white ellipse except the UK, Spain and Portugal which do not have anything.
</p>
<p class="contents">There is a need to make life simpler for the motorist. The Commission's proposal does just that and I commend it. However, as the Commission will be aware, motorists throughout Europe are much more European than perhaps we think. They are of course rebelling against the Vienna and the Geneva Convention, and indeed his own proposal, by adopting their own symbol of European unity. Therefore I would like to draw the attention of the Commissioner and Members to our Amendments Nos 4, 5, 6 and 7 which recognise the reality that many motorists do not like the Vienna Convention symbol, the rather boring black letters on a white background, but prefer the European symbol of the white and yellow letters with the gold stars on a blue background in accordance with their particular national registration. I hope that the Commissioner will agree with our argument that we should give the motorists a choice.
</p>
<p class="contents">Why is it that motorists in Greece or the UK – it could be my car, Commissioner ‐have to remove their European symbol and replace it with a white sticker with black letters when they travel to France? That to me seems a backward step. Our amendment is trying to be helpful by giving motorists that choice, that additional right to display a European symbol if they so desire rather than the white ellipse. I commend it to you, Commissioner, and I commend it to the House.

(DE)</span> Mr President, Commissioner, ladies and gentlemen, I too would like to talk about the second Le Rachinel report. The present proposal for a regulation remedies the lack of similarity between the separate national legislations. The Community model for the distinguishing sign of the Member State licensing of vehicles and trailers in internal Community traffic, let us call it the European nationality plate, is long overdue. Such a measure directly helps to include and raise the awareness of the citizens of the Union in the creation of an area without internal borders and to form and establish a feeling of European identity, while contributing indirectly to n increase in road traffic safety. In particular, the demand that the proposed Community sign must be located both at the front and at the back on the left beside the registration plate will be an advantage for the police and other administrative and judicial bodies.
</p>
<p class="contents">Although on behalf of the Group of the European People"s Party I completely support Mr Le Rachinel"s report and thank him for his work, it seems to me personally that the Commission"s proposal for a regulation is not completely logical. Let us just consider: in a few weeks the third phase of European economic and monetary union begins, which will lead to a domestic market, the formal external appearance of which will be the single currency. What a magnificent achievement, proving our great farsightedness! With the distinguishing sign for vehicles and trailers the Europeans are failing to achieve logical standardization in the form of a common, standard design principle. Thus, with reference to the principle of subsidiarity, the EU Member States are obliged in fact to recognize the proposed Community model, but the validity of existing nationality plates remains completely unrestricted and continues to exist, independent of the Community model.
</p>
<p class="contents">There is not even a reference to the fact that in the Member States the Community model should preferably be used. In view of this fact, I could even understand if citizens from third countries were doubtful of the ability and/or seriousness of the efforts of EU to build a political union.
</p>
<p class="contents">For the vehicle owners of the Member States who have already accepted, on a compulsory or voluntary basis, the use of the Community model – it is of course not a new invention –, the present proposal for a regulation takes up a long‐standing desire for legal certainty and is recognition – let us call it personal – of the costs they often willingly incurred when buying this combined vehicle registration plate.
</p>
<p class="contents">For me, too, it is desirable that third countries, above all the countries of the European Economic Area but also the associated countries of central and eastern Europe give legally binding recognition to the Community model. I recommend that we accept this report.

(DE)</span> Mr President, Commissioner, ladies and gentlemen, I would like briefly to express an opinion on Mr Le Rachinel"s report on the transport of dangerous goods by road. One of the Union"s aims is the completion of the single market. We should do everything we can to guarantee its successful operation by implementing suitable measures. In this sense the free passage of vehicles transporting dangerous goods should be possible. Above all, I believe it is very appropriate to harmonize design features and technical specifications, for example on brake fittings, speed limitations or electrical equipment, to guarantee free passage within the Community.
</p>
<p class="contents">The creation of a European type‐approval system will help ensure that in future no Member State will be able, on grounds which relate to design features, to prohibit a vehicle manufacturer from offering it for sale, or to refuse its approval or use. The Member States should thus be obliged to produce the necessary legal and administrative regulations within 12 months of the publication of this directive.

<span class="italic">
(DE)</span> Mr President, Commissioner, ladies and gentlemen, at this late hour we are once again discussing transport policy questions. Let me make just two short remarks. Firstly, I would like to look at the issue of transportable pressure equipment which unfortunately has figured too briefly in this joint debate. This is a very important matter, not only from a technical viewpoint – although to me as an engineer it appears thoroughly interesting, ‐ but it also as regards the question of safety of everything which travels on our roads. It concerns the question of regular monitoring and the capability to carry out this monitoring and I think that here it is the rapporteur, whom I would like to thank sincerely, who has succeeded in presenting a balanced report. I can only ask the Commission to listen carefully to Parliament.
</p>
<p class="contents">Secondly, I would like to consider the distinguishing sign of the Member State of registration, that is, the national registration plate. I consider that, too, to be an important proposal and Mr Koch referred to the problems which we still face. Here at last we have a regulation with which we can bring Europe to life. As well as the standard driving licence, which has already been decided on, it is a further symbol to make Europe come to life. It is a citizen‐friendly decision which makes administration simpler. I would just like to ask you, Commissioner, to take this up perhaps in negotiations with Switzerland too, because it is not sensible or logical to introduce it throughout Europe, and have it recognized in the European Economic Area, and in the associated states, while right in the middle of Europe we have an Island of the Blissful, where we still have to have our stickers. I ask that you take this up in the negotiations.</p>

<img align="absmiddle" alt="" src="https://europarl.europa.eu/doceo/data/img/arrow_summary.gif"/>  <span class="doc_subtitle_level1_bis">Kinnock, Neil, </span>
<span class="italic">
Member of the Commission.</span> – Mr President, I wish to begin by thanking Mr Le Rachinel for his two reports, firstly on the proposal relating to the type‐approval of motor vehicles and trailers intended for the transport of dangerous goods by road and, secondly, on the distinguishing sign for vehicles.</p>
<p class="contents">On the first report, I am pleased to say that the Commission accepts Mr Le Rachinel's single amendment, since the additional wording he suggests on Article 6 provides the correct legal term for the date of implementation and does not in any way contradict or change the intention of the Commission proposal.
</p>
<p class="contents">This legislation, as the House will know, is an important step towards harmonization of the laws of Member States on typeapproval procedures relating to vehicles carrying dangerous goods. I am therefore grateful for the constructive approach taken by the rapporteur and his colleagues. Colleagues, indeed, like Mr Morris who, in an erudite and convincing speech, would not only have demolished any doubts at all about the transport of dangerous goods but probably have persuaded everyone that Wales should have its very own distinctive number plate. That would, of course, be permissible, as we see evidenced by the fact that in the Republic of Ireland the name of the region is given on the numberplate in Erse and in Germany the Land badge is also shown conventionally on the numberplates. So I am looking forward to seeing a 
<span class="italic">
draig goch</span>, the red dragon, on Mr Morris' numberplate. I am sure that would be a very popular step. Not that I would 
<span class="italic">
dream</span> of intervening in subsidiarity to advocate it publicly.
</p>
<p class="contents">Mr Le Rachinel's second report concerns numberplates. Because of press misreporting, which has on occasion misinformed public opinion on the issue of vehicle numberplates and distinguishing signs, I think it wise to begin my short response to this very constructive report by saying what the proposal does 
<span class="italic">
not</span> mean. Firstly, it does not have any suggestion that Member States must provide numberplates which incorporate the symbol of the European Union. Secondly, it does not have any suggestion that all vehicles must show the symbol of the country of registration.
</p>
<p class="contents">I specify this because Mr Jarzembowski will I know be interested to be informed that a couple of years ago the 
<span class="italic">
Daily Mail</span> – not a newspaper that I customarily buy – incredibly printed a front‐page story about me going to impose Euro‐numberplates on all unsuspecting citizens of the Union. The story was so inaccurate, misleading and mischievous, that I sued the 
<span class="italic">
Daily Mail</span> and, I am happy to say, successfully. I hope that they will record, with precision, what this proposal does and does not do.
</p>
<p class="contents">The aim of the proposal is simply to ensure that where the rear numberplate on a vehicle shows the distinguishing sign of the Member State of registration, on the background of the symbol of the Community, the distinguishing sign is recognized by the other Member States as a valid identification of the country of registration, without further need for the vehicle to show any other sign. That includes the elliptic sticker, the rugby‐ball‐shaped sticker specified by the Vienna Convention. It may be, of course, as far as Mr Morris is concerned, that shape of sticker would do for Wales, but I understand that too.
</p>
<p class="contents">I know that Members of this House understand that and I would like, therefore, to respond to the amendments tabled by the Committee on Transport and Tourism. First, we welcome Amendment No 2 and the first part of Amendment No 3, which extends the coverage of the regulation to trailers. We can also accept the second part of Amendment No 3, which refers to the position of the distinguishing sign on the left‐hand side of the numberplate. In addition, we can accept in principle the last part of Amendment No 3 that refers to other official signs. But we believe that the wording and the purpose of the recognition, which is to identify the state of registration of the vehicle, could be more specific.
</p>
<p class="contents">The Commission cannot accept Amendment No 1, which is intended to introduce a requirement to affix the distinguishing sign of registration on the left‐hand side of the plate. However, the amendment actually changes the legal term distinguishing registration signs, which simply means the official abbreviation used to denote the Member State. The term itself and the definition are consistent with the Vienna Convention, which is as it should be.
</p>
<p class="contents">As in the case of the Convention, the size, shape and location of the distinguishing registration sign are specified in the Annex, although that provision is now also covered by the second part of Amendment No 3, which, as I said to the House, we have accepted.
</p>
<p class="contents">Amendments Nos 4 to 7 have been tabled by Mr Simpson with the purpose of sanctioning or regularizing the practice of using stickers in the form of the European symbol containing the abbreviation of the country of origin. I have to say that Mr Watts did a job of which any salesman would be immensely proud in the course of the debate tonight. As a consequence, I have some sympathy for the idea.
</p>
<p class="contents">However, I have to tell the House that these amendments do not meet the need to lay down the technical specifications with sufficient detail to achieve mutual recognition. Well I can always mutually recognize Mr Jarzembowski even if I cannot hear precisely what he is saying! Our proposal makes mutual recognition possible precisely because the sign is issued under the control of the national authorities as part of an official numberplate, and that would clearly not be the case for the separate sticker.
</p>
<p class="contents">The eighth and final amendment by Mr Cornelissen is unnecessary since the regulation, once adopted, will be automatically applicable in the European Economic Area. Incidentally, I think history is being made. It is ten past eleven on a night in Strasbourg. We are having a transport debate and Mr Cornelissen is not actually here. This must be the first time in history and I am sure there is a very good reason for it.
</p>
<p class="contents">I now turn to the third report and I would like to thank Mr Camisón for the time and effort that he spent on this complex technical proposal related to safety in the movement of transportable pressure equipment. As the House will know, by adopting Directives 94/55 and 96/49, the Council has already ensured a high level of safety in the movement of transportable equipment by defining common rules on design, materials, filling and periodic testing of such equipment. However, one further demand needs to be met.
</p>
<p class="contents">The current situation is that transportable pressure equipment, for instance gas cylinders, moved from one Member State to another and then used cannot be refilled in the receiving Member State and then transported back to the first Member State without being retested, inspected and approved in the receiving country. This threatens the very existence of the single market and so obviously has to be changed. In the absence of mutual recognition of the conformity procedures and of markings of the inspection bodies in different Member States, these conditions will continue. The proposal before the House therefore seeks to rectify that. A further effect of this proposal is to ensure free circulation of transportable pressure equipment in the internal market, a facility which is not possible now because Directive 97/23 on pressure equipment excludes transportable pressure equipment from the scope.
</p>
<p class="contents">Since Amendments Nos 4, 6, 7, 11, 12 and 19 are consistent with the aims of the proposal, the Commission is able to accept them and, as a consequence of accepting Amendments Nos 6 and 19, the Commission is able to accept Amendments Nos 10 and 20 in so far as they relate to the date.
</p>
<p class="contents">When I conclude my time in the Commission, I can always get a job as the person who announces the lottery results on BBC television on Saturday nights. I have been training for that for some time. Señor Camisón's report provides me with the unique rehearsal in this number reading skill.
</p>
<p class="contents">Amendment No 9 deletes Type C inspection bodies and there are related editorial changes in Amendments Nos 5, 8, 10, 11, 13, 15, 17, 18, 20, 23, 24, 25, 26, 27 and 28. They can all be accepted by the Commission if the definition of Type B inspection bodies is modified. We will therefore frame our revised proposal accordingly. And people say that DG VII functionaries do not earn their money! The other amendments, however, are not acceptable. Amendment No 1 is rejected since that ‚whereas’ clause is limited to the main objective of the proposal: transport safety. Amendments Nos 2 and 3 are primarily editorial changes but they are rejected because the original text is more accurate. Amendment No 14 is rejected because the limitation solely to existing Type B inspection bodies is too restrictive and would prevent new Type B inspection bodies from entering the market. Amendment Nos 16 and 20 are rejected since the Commission considers that frequency of controls upon relevant bodies and the details rightly fall under the competence of the Member States. Amendment No 22 is also rejected because it would not allow the same undertaking to be engaged in maintenance and periodic inspection and is therefore, in the view of the Commission, too restrictive.
</p>
<p class="contents">As I said at the outset, this is a technical proposal which is nevertheless a further contribution to safety in transport and I am grateful for the fact that it has the support of the rapporteur, Señor Camisón, and indeed of the House. Naturally I am pleased to note that the large number of amendments manifests the attention to detail that the proposal has received from the Transport Committee rather than any real differences of substance between European Parliament and the Commission on the issue. Dealing with three different proposals in one debate is obviously not easy and this is even more true when the proposals and the discussion are particularly technical. I know, however, that the House is well able to cope with such situations, apparently better than the Commission, and I look forward to progress on all three measures now before the Parliament. I must say that history is being broken for the second time in the course of this debate. Not only is Mr Cornelissen not here but I have managed, having been given 15 minutes of the Parliament's precious time, to finish in 13 minutes and 58 seconds.

I am also, as a special concession to Mr Jarzembowski, prepared to call the Swiss Transport Minister and recommend that in order that Mr Jarzembowski can wear any plates that he likes, he do so for the small consideration of paying double the Swiss vignette in order to pass through the country.

<span class="bold">
.</span> – Mr President, it is an honour for me to welcome you to the European Parliament.  It is not only an honour, but also a source of personal and political satisfaction.
</p>
<p class="contents">Firstly, it is a source of personal satisfaction because of your human and political qualities.  It is never easy to fight for democratic values in an authoritarian context, as you have done. Nor is it easy to defend the supremacy of civilian power over military power.  Your entire political career, as a member of parliament for over twenty years, as a minister, and as mayor of Lisbon, denotes an unwavering commitment to the democratic values that have permitted the European Union today to become the world"s largest democratic territory.
</p>
<p class="contents">You are aware of the nature of my own links with Portugal.  That is why it is particularly gratifying to me that the President of the Republic of Portugal should be the first Head of State that we welcome to a plenary session following my election as President.  Ladies and gentlemen, President Jorge Sampaio"s presence here should also constitute a source of political satisfaction.  The hurly‐burly of European debate with the, sometimes simplistic, manifestations of nationalism that it occasionally involves, at times prevents us from perceiving what is most important.
</p>
<p class="contents">Portugal is an example of how a country with an age‐old culture has resumed its full role in Europe under difficult circumstances to do with an exceptionally rapid decolonization process and the consolidation of its democracy.
</p>
<p class="contents">Portugal has done as it should, as the founding fathers prescribed, seeking its individual interest in the common interest.  At this time, when the cohesion process is beginning, on the threshold of the introduction of the single currency and the ratification of the Treaty of Amsterdam, events which will have a decisive influence on Europe"s place during the next century, Portugal represents an example that should not be overlooked.  Mr President, you, who symbolize these values, have the floor.

<span class="italic">
President of the Portuguese Republic. – (PT)</span> Mr President, allow me to begin by greeting you with the greatest admiration and personal esteem, and thanking you for addressing me in my own language. This bears witness to your talents, and also to your own career because, had it not been for the struggle against dictatorships, today you might perhaps not speak Portuguese as well as you do. Allow me therefore, Mr President, to greet you personally and in your capacity as representative of the House.</p>
<p class="contents">Ladies and gentlemen, I am privileged to have this opportunity to address the European Parliament, this exemplary institution which in a unique manner represents the essential nature of the European Union as a democratic community.
</p>
<p class="contents">May I thank you for this opportunity which is an honour to me and to the country which I represent. I would like, first and foremost, to greet the Members of this Parliament, who are the legitimate representatives of the community of nations committed to pursuing a unique project.
</p>
<p class="contents">Naturally, I extend this greeting on behalf of the members of the Portuguese Government and of the representatives of all the parties which hold seats in the Portuguese Parliament who are accompanying me on this visit.
</p>
<p class="contents">Allow me to make a special mention of the Portuguese Members, and all the Portuguese officials working in this Parliament, and to express my gratitude to them for the important work they are conducting in these bodies, in the pursuit of European ideals.
</p>
<p class="contents">Dyed‐in‐the‐wool Euro‐enthusiast that I am, and also as a former member of parliament, this meeting with you, Mr President, ladies and gentlemen, is particularly significant. May I also, Mr President, greet the President of the European Commission and the Commissioners present.
</p>
<p class="contents">Ladies and gentlemen, in meeting the challenges inherent in the construction of the European Union, this Parliament will always occupy a central position in the discussion of ideas and in defining the proposals that will shape our collective future. I therefore consider this to be the most appropriate place for carrying out an evaluation of the state of the European Union, as a new phase is about to begin in the integration process, and for sharing with you our own views regarding the evolution of this process.
</p>
<p class="contents">Today, on the threshold of the transition to the third phase of economic and monetary union and of the introduction of the single European currency, we see that we have indeed succeeded in meeting the requirements of this crucial stage, despite the scepticism of those who prophesied the decline of Europe and notwithstanding political and institutional resistance to change. We may all take satisfaction in the success to which the European Parliament and its members made a decisive contribution at every stage.
</p>
<p class="contents">Today, Portugal is a country that has, to a large extent, successfully overcome the structural backwardness that is the corollary of a backward economy. Naturally, we have not yet achieved the levels of economic progress to which we aspire, levels that are comparable to those of Europe"s most developed countries. Obviously, there have been costs involved in reconverting our economy in response to the pressures of globalization. Nonetheless, contrary to the most pessimistic forecasts, we have been able to fulfill scrupulously all the conditions for guaranteeing our full participation in the third phase of economic and monetary union within the stipulated time frames.
</p>
<p class="contents">The continuity of this strategy, which has been formulated in such a way as to be consistent with the Treaty of Maastricht and with national interests, can be guaranteed only by a solid consensus between the main political parties of Portugal, the support of the various trends of public opinion – some which are certainly critical but all of which understand the scope of the objectives pursued –, the open‐mindedness of the economic agents, businessmen and trade unions, who are prepared to understand that essential sacrifices must be made to meet the challenges of modernisation and of the new phase in European integration.
</p>
<p class="contents">Thus, Portugal will be among the founders of the single currency, and will be firm in its determination to guarantee the success of a strong European currency, an essential instrument of progress for our economies and of a growing European influence on the world stage. We will be among the front‐runners during this new cycle of the construction of the European Union, which affords us understandable pride, but also a sense of heightened responsibility regarding our own participation in the construction of the Europe of the next century. For the Portuguese, this step is one of particular historical significance, in that it fulfills the enlightened decision of those who wished to associate the fate of our own democracy with Portugal"s integration in Europe.
</p>
<p class="contents">Once the dictatorship had fallen, we were able once more to embrace fully our centuries‐old vocation. We did not return to Europe, for we had always been part of it, but we assumed fully, with freedom and democracy, our own identity, our European identity, in the same way that we resumed our natural humanist and universalist tradition.
</p>
<p class="contents">It is in this spirit that this year we celebrate our maritime exploits, with the 500th anniversary of Vasco da Gama"s historic voyage and also, in the world exhibition of Lisbon, Expo 98, the unfailing and enriching encounter between peoples and cultures, the peace and progress that we would have everybody achieve, the solidarity between nations. We consider that the importance of the oceans as world heritage, which is the central theme of Expo 98, , also justifies the creation of a special agency devoted to its protection. Lisbon is eager to host this agency, and we will offer it our fullest support and the wealth of our experience in this subject area.
</p>
<p class="contents">Ladies and gentlemen, we have reached a turning point, and it is up to us to identify the major challenges in the European process, which will enable us to set a safe course for our common destiny. In my view, these challenges relate to the enlargement of the Union, the model for the construction of the European Union and the need to respond to the signs of crisis that are proliferating in our democratic societies.
</p>
<p class="contents">The enlargement of the Union, to include the new democracies of central and eastern Europe within its political and institutional boundaries is, without question, the next step in the construction of the European Union, and in which its political credibility resides. To the extent that they are both intended to achieve the same end, the deepening and broadening of the European Union are inseparable.
</p>
<p class="contents">Portugal has always, without hesitation, supported the legitimate aspirations of European countries which, following their return to democracy, wished to accede to this region of progress, freedom and security. We welcome the formula that has been found to ensure that the countries which do not join during the first phase of Union enlargement will not feel excluded.
</p>
<p class="contents">In the eyes of the Portuguese, this subject is particularly sensitive, both on account obviously of our own experience, where accession to the European Community constituted an irreplaceable factor of convergence between the stabilization of the democratic process and our “return to Europe’ after decolonization. Therefore, for us, there can be no question that the same solidarity we received following the restoration of democracy in Portugal should be extended to the present applicant countries.
</p>
<p class="contents">Naturally, I neither wish, nor am I able, to play down the complexity of the forthcoming enlargement; we cannot overlook the state of the economic structures that exist in the applicant countries, or the anticipated social effects of their membership. Moreover, we cannot accept that enlargement should become an element of dissolution of the European project, or that it should weaken the existing level of integration or the degree of economic and social cohesion between the states of the Union. Enlargement is not, and cannot be pursued to the detriment of the cohesion or of the degree of integration that has already been achieved.
</p>
<p class="contents">Similarly, enlargement involves a combined effort by the Union, an effort by all, and should be approached in this frame of mind. These are the objectives which will guide our actions, firmly, but without relieving us of the responsibly of defending the need for enlargement.
</p>
<p class="contents">Mr President, ladies and gentlemen, the second issue that I would like to raise concerns the alternative models of the construction of the European Union which are bound, once more, to become a central topic of discussion.
</p>
<p class="contents">It is not my intention, nor would it be appropriate, for me to speak in favour a particular model, but I would like to say that, in my opinion, the specific nature and strength of the European Union lie in the fact that it is an alliance of democratic countries and an association of sovereign entities, of ancient states and long‐standing nations, which are justifiably attached to their individuality and to their identity. The pace of the integration process has been dictated by the possibility, at each stage, of finding ways of reconciling common interests with national interests, reciprocally strengthening states and also Community institutions. Thus, the introduction of a single currency represents an immense qualitative leap forward. Consequently, we are duty‐bound to examine the need to further our political integration in such a way as to guarantee that the conditions of cohesion throughout the European Union can be maintained, democratic transparency enhanced and our identity on the international stage rendered more prominent.
</p>
<p class="contents">I think we all agree that, in the absence of appropriate compensatory policies, the economic and monetary integration process could exacerbate economic and standard of living disparities between the regions making the Union. I would consider it to be essential for the Union to preserve its fundamental nature as an association of sovereign states, linked by common interests, a community of equals, in which the relative position of each Member State is maintained, residing on the principles of solidarity and cohesion, which are essential in guaranteeing the possibility of achieving real economic convergence.
</p>
<p class="contents">A range of possibilities on which to test our capacity for initiative now lies open, particularly as regards the expansion of a community under the rule of law and of rights, and in the sphere of the Union"s common foreign and security policy. The development of the rule of law constitutes one of the most solid and long‐standing identifying features of European civilization. Our affinities in this area represent a solid foundation on which we may base ever more numerous initiatives, either with a view to achieving convergence between national legal models, or to laying the foundations for European citizenship. For the purpose of constructing a European political identity gradually, I would consider this course, based on the rule of law and on rights, to be more productive than any effort to impose, from the top downwards, a ready‐made and definitive European constitution, which might fail to involve the participation of the citizens of Europe.
</p>
<p class="contents">In the light of existing circumstances, progress in the area of foreign policy will be slow. For this reason, it is particularly important that the current impetus of activities should be maintained, particularly in responding to situations of crisis. Europe should assume increased responsibilities in defending its own common interests, particularly in relation to Russia and the Ukraine, as well as in the Middle East peace process, in relations with our Mediterranean partners, and as regards Africa and Latin America. Allow me, however, to mention briefly some points that I consider to be of particular importance in this regard.
</p>
<p class="contents">The Atlantic Alliance plays a decisive role as guarantor of regional stability, and it is in a position to confirm its central role in the architecture of European defence, but it is essential, in conjunction with the West European Union, to develop a European Defence and Security Identity and that it should be developed as a crucial and increasingly prominent factor of stability, to enhance European cooperation and institutionalize new balances in our relations with our North American allies.
</p>
<p class="contents">Efforts must be kept up in Bosnia in order to ensure not only that hostilities are kept in check, but also to guarantee effective conditions for peace.
</p>
<p class="contents">We also have particular responsibilities regarding our Mediterranean partners; our own security depends to a large extent on their progress and stability. The Barcelona process must be carried forward in a decisive manner, in order to avoid a clearlyunderstandable accumulation of frustrations and resentment, which severely undermines our own international credibility. As regards Turkey, this European vocation is not in any doubt, provided that its inherent models are respected. It seems to me that the conclusions of the European Council of Luxemburg put forward, without preconceptions, a realistic framework for strengthening our mutual relations.
</p>
<p class="contents">Turning now to Africa, I know that you are aware that Portugal has offered to host a European Union‐Africa Summit during our EU presidency. I am convinced that this would be an important step in overcoming a degree of “Afro‐pessimism’, and serve to strengthen decisively  our cooperation with a continent to which we are linked by so many ties.
</p>
<p class="contents">Likewise, we should continue to give the closest attention to boosting relations between Europe and Latin America. As a member of the Ibero‐American Community, we will this year be hosting the organization"s 8th Summit, which is devoted precisely to the subject of inter‐regional integration.
</p>
<p class="contents">In addition, I consider it to be particularly important to raise the profile of the defence of international law and human rights in constructing a common foreign policy, which constitutes a framework for defining the European Union"s international identity.
</p>
<p class="contents">As you might expect, Mr President, ladies and gentlemen, in this context I would like to raise the matter of East Timor, which has assumed increasing prominence in European foreign policy, as demonstrated by the adoption of a common position by Member States and by the resolutions approved by this Parliament during the past year. Both factors reflect the Union"s active commitment to defending the rights of a martyred community which is subjugated by a regime of illegal and brutal occupation. Portugal has but one interest, I repeat one interest, as regards East Timor: to defend the rights of the Timorese, including the free and democratic exercise of its right to self determination. We are persevering, with the most constructive attitude and with the fullest respect for these principles, in our quest for a peaceful and democratic solution to the Timorese question, within the framework of the conversations that are currently being conducted under the auspices of the Secretary General of the United Nations. Moreover, as a prerequisite to an ultimate solution, immediate improvements must, I repeat must, be made in the Territory as regards respect for human rights, particularly the freeing of political prisoners and a significant reduction of the miliary presence, which are essential if a climate is to be created that is conducive to the establishment of genuine dialogue between all the parties involved. While the present crisis in Indonesia may, I hope, open up new possibilities, we are also concerned that uncontrolled violence may escalate in East Timor. I appeal to the solidarity of the European Parliament, whose initiatives have revealed  for the Timorese cause an unwavering support, which is all the more necessary during this period of turmoil.
</p>
<p class="contents"><span class="italic">
<span class="italic">
(Applause)</span> </span></p>
<p class="contents">Mr President, ladies and gentlemen, the final point I would like to raise concerns the need to respond to the signs of crisis that are proliferating in our societies and which are the result, particularly, of tensions between economic modernisation and social cohesion. The dysfunctions of the market economy, with mass unemployment and with the phenomena of exclusion, inequality and poverty ever more rife, are testing the limits of tolerance of our democratic regimes. Nobody contests the fact that the European social model is currently beset by a crisis of change which, for the first time, is simultaneously, although at different stages, affecting all the states of the European Union. In this unprecedented context, the crisis of the social model is a European crisis which, with increasing urgency, demands not only specific strategies of reform in each Member State, but also, and more particularly, calls for common European responses. We need a concerted response, with a view to reinventing the social contract which is an identifying feature and corner‐stone of our democracies.
</p>
<p class="contents">I am convinced that it would be impossible to tackle the new challenges effectively should the differences in approach by Member States to social protection and regulation of the labour market become more acute, turning them into a further element of tension within our states and, consequently, within the Union itself.
</p>
<p class="contents">The crisis represents a unique opportunity to complement our monetary unification process with the development of a joint economic policy that is able to turn the single currency into an essential instrument of international economic competition, and a springboard for modernisation and social cohesion in Europe, without which neither sustainable growth nor democratic stability is possible.
</p>
<p class="contents">Mr President, ladies and gentlemen, on the foundations of the consultative and monitoring role originally assigned to it, this Parliament has gradually won competences and powers to intervene in the decision‐making process, which are consistent with its democratic legitimacy and which have proved to be essential in developing and deepening European integration. We cannot but welcome this development. I most firmly believe that the position of Parliament should be constantly enhanced. This conviction is strengthened by the upsurge of anti‐democratic trends, intolerable manifestations of racism and xenophobia, and the violence that invariably accompanies them. Economic and social progress in Europe must take place within a context of respect for the values of community, life, freedom and justice.
</p>
<p class="contents">After Amsterdam, we must continue to advance together towards the establishment of a broad European culture of freedoms, founded on a consensus‐based model of internal security and developing ultimately into a European legal territory.
</p>
<p class="contents">We share the perception that our citizens, the thinking women and men, who voice their opinions and who choose freely, are the seat of all power. The European integration process should pursue the unswerving aim of strengthening the conditions for exercising citizenship, increasing participation, mobilizing our citizens, their imagination and creativity ever more effectively. It is essential that our citizens" commitment to the construction of the European Union should be strengthened, to increase that solidarity which is to the advantage of all. A political architecture for Europe must be found that guarantees the necessary representation in a territory characterised by an immense cultural and linguistic diversity. Without such a guarantee, European citizenship will never amount to more than a generous intention, since the citizens of our countries will not perceive Europe as a territory for personal fulfilment. Indeed, the more citizens feel themselves to be represented in institutions, and feel these institutions to be close to them, reflecting their own concerns, the better will they understand Europe and the more open they will be to the advance of the integration process.
</p>
<p class="contents">I do not deny that this is a difficult task, that we must all work with increasing zeal to raise the profile of the European Parliament in our societies. By bringing prestige to the European Parliament, we bring prestige to European democracy.
</p>
<p class="contents">The European project must always be a political project, based on values and principles, a project which seeks to guarantee stability and greater economic and social prosperity. The construction of the European Union must be pursued in a manner that preserves and protects the progress already made towards integration, with continued joint and united effort. The dissolution of Europe will certainly not strengthen it.
</p>
<p class="contents">As the legitimate representative body of the peoples of the States making up the Union, it falls to the European Parliament to play a fundamental and vital role in this process, promoting cohesion and ensuring that it remains a central priority in the context of Community policies. To this end, I am convinced that the Parliament will continue to mirror attentively the legitimate ambitions of these same peoples as a whole, and be the guardian of the European project of European ideas, defending our shared values above ephemeral interests and individual motivation.
</p>
<p class="contents">This is the only way in which we may effectively contradict the prophets of doom and counter pessimism and loss of faith, selfish interests and ambitions. This is the only way in which we can, with confidence, embark upon this new stage of the construction of the European Union, a stage during which the Union will be enlarged to include all the European democracies, and relations between Member States grow closer, a stage characterized by the need to strengthen cohesion and solidarity between all our peoples.
</p>
<p class="contents">This, Mr President, ladies and gentlemen, is a prime aspiration for the next millennium which involves and mobilizes every individual. We should not, indeed we cannot, allow this immense opportunity to be wasted.

Question No 20 by Nikitas Kaklamanis (H−0040/98)</span> </span></p>
<p class="contents">Subject: Outlawed party in Turkey
</p>
<p class="contents">The decision by the Turkish Constitutional Court to outlaw the Welfare Party led by Necmettin Erbakan is a cause of deep concern among the international community. The practical abolition of democratic pluralism in Turkey is not, of course, unprecedented. In 1994, the Democracy Party was outlawed on grounds of cooperating with the Labour Party of Kurdistan. Four former Members of Parliament belonging to that party, including Leila Zana, are still in prison. Islamic fundamentalism in democratic countries cannot be countered by means of court judgments. Prohibiting diversity of opinion and freedom of expression is not a feature of democratic multiparty systems.
</p>
<p class="contents">How will the Council respond to Turkey's undemocratic conduct, which is in breach of the basic principles of its customs union with the EU?
</p>
<p class="contents"><span class="italic">
<span class="italic">
Answer</span> </span></p>
<p class="contents">The Presidency issued a declaration on behalf of the European Union on the banning of the Refah party in Turkey on 21 January 1998. The EU noted with regret the decision of the Turkish Constitutional Court on 16 January 1998 to order the closure of the Welfare Party, to confiscate its property, and to ban certain present and former members of that party from being members of the Turkish Parliament or from further political activity for five years.
</p>
<p class="contents">The European Union also noted statements by the Turkish authorities that this decision was in accordance with the provisions of the Turkish Constitution. However, the European Union is concerned at the implications for democratic pluralism and freedom of expression, and hopes that Turkey will make clear its continuing commitment to these fundamental democratic principles.
</p>
<p class="contents">These concerns are supported by a recent ruling of the European Court of Human Rights, condemning Turkey for having banned the Former Democracy Party in 1991.
</p>
<p class="contents">The European Council meeting in Luxembourg on 12‐13 December 1997 again underlined the necessity for the Turkish Government to meet its fundamental obligations in the field of democracy and human rights. It recalled, in line with the council position expressed at the Association Council with Turkey on 29 April 1997, that strengthening Turkey's links with the EU also depended on that country's pursuit of political reforms including the alignment of human rights standards and practices with those in the European Union.
</p>
<p class="contents">The situation of democracy and human rights in Turkey remains high on the Council's agenda in contacts with the Turkish authorities.

Question No 21 by David Martin (H−0041/98)</span> </span></p>
<p class="contents">Subject: Human rights in Nigeria
</p>
<p class="contents">In the light of continuing reports of human rights abuses in Nigeria, would the Council raise with the Nigerian Government the serious concerns for the safety of Gbenga Adebusuyi following reports by Amnesty International of his torture and ill‐treatment.
</p>
<p class="contents"><span class="italic">
<span class="italic">
Answer</span> </span></p>
<p class="contents">The Council is concerned at reports of ill‐treatment by the Nigerian authorities of Dr Adebusuyi who, it understands, was charged with treason, with fifteen others, in March 1997, although he is said to have been held in custody for some time before that.
</p>
<p class="contents">The European Union has repeatedly expressed its grave concern at the human rights situation in Nigeria, including the detention of political prisoners. The Council of Ministers reflected this on 28 November 1997 with its decision to extend the EU Common Position on Nigeria of 4 November 1995 until 1 November 1998. Most recently, on 26 December 1997 the Luxembourg Presidency issued a declaration on behalf of the EU following the arrests of General Diya and eleven others accused of attempting to carry out a coup d'état. This made it clear that the EU could not accept a repetition of the events of 1995 concerning the trial and execution of Ken Saro‐Wiwa and his Ogoni co‐defendants.
</p>
<p class="contents">The EU has intervened on many occasions in different fora on behalf of political prisoners in Nigeria and will continue to do so.

Question No 22 by Hugh McMahon (H−0043/98)</span> </span></p>
<p class="contents">Subject: Possible amendments to the Acquired Rights Directive
</p>
<p class="contents">With reference to the priorities laid down by the President‐in‐Office during Parliament's January 1998 part‐session, can the President‐in‐Office inform Parliament whether the Council intends to pursue possible amendments to the Acquired Rights Directive in order to clarify the scope of this very important piece of employment protection legislation?
</p>
<p class="contents"><span class="italic">
<span class="italic">
Answer</span> </span></p>
<p class="contents">Work within the Council on the amended proposal for a Directive concerning the safeguarding of employees' rights in the event of transfers of undertakings, businesses or parts of businesses – which was submitted by the Commission in February 1997 – has resumed under the UK Presidency.
</p>
<p class="contents">This proposal aims at amending the 1977 Directive (77/187/EEC) so as to take into account recent developments in the case law of the Court of Justice and particularly the protection of the rights of workers and their adequate information and consultation. In that context, one of the key questions to be addressed by the Council will be that of the scope of the Directive.
</p>
<p class="contents">The UK Presidency is hoping that a political agreement may be reached on the text during the Council session of June 1998.

Question No 23 by Peter Truscott (H−0049/98)</span> </span></p>
<p class="contents">Subject: European Conference
</p>
<p class="contents">Could the President‐in‐Office outline the plans for the European Conference scheduled for 12 March and the efforts to ensure that the enlargement process is truly inclusive for all the applicant countries?
</p>
<p class="contents"><span class="italic">
<span class="italic">
Answer</span> </span></p>
<p class="contents">As the Honourable Member will be aware, the Luxembourg European Council established the inclusive nature of the enlargement process. A key element of this is the European Conference which the UK Presidency will inaugurate in London on 12 March. Luxembourg invites the participation on an equal footing of the existing EU Member States, the ten Central European applicants, Cyprus and Turkey to discuss issues of common interest. The Accession Process will be launched on 30 March at Foreign Minister level with the Central Europeans and Cyprus. And accession negotiations will be opened with the five Central Europeans and Cyprus on 31 March. All countries will proceed at their own individual pace, and those not yet negotiating can start as soon as they are ready.

Question No 24 by Paul Rübig (H−0052/98)</span> </span></p>
<p class="contents">Subject: Crime in Brussels
</p>
<p class="contents">We talk a great deal about international crime and combating crime, but we are not even able to guarantee our own safety and the safety of our staff in the very heart of the European Union.
</p>
<p class="contents">In the past two months, an Austrian Member was the victim of a brutal mugging in Brussels. What is more, in my office alone two trainees and a female member of our press office staff were threatened, robbed or mugged. Many colleagues from other countries and other political groups can report similar incidents.
</p>
<p class="contents">Does the Council recognize the need for action to deal with this situation and, if so, who should take it? In particular, does it believe that it is the responsibility of the local authorities to eliminate this glaring breakdown in security?
</p>
<p class="contents"><span class="italic">
<span class="italic">
Answer</span> </span></p>
<p class="contents">In reply to the Honourable Member's question, I should point out that the Council has never been called upon to discuss the problems raised in it.

Question No 25 by Brian Simpson (H−0053/98)</span> </span></p>
<p class="contents">Subject: Trans‐European networks
</p>
<p class="contents">Does the Council of Ministers still see the priority projects within the Trans‐European Transport Networks as being important? Furthermore, what progress has been made in implementing these schemes, particularly the upgrading of the main West Coast railway line in the UK?
</p>
<p class="contents"><span class="italic">
<span class="italic">
Answer</span> </span></p>
<p class="contents">In the context of setting up the Trans‐European Networks, the Essen European Council placed particular emphasis on the implementation of a number of projects, including the West Coast Mainline in the United Kingdom.
</p>
<p class="contents">This interest was expressed in Article 19 and in Annex III of Decision No 1692/96/EC of the European Parliament and of the Council of 23 July 1996 on Community guidelines for the development of the Trans‐European Transport Networks. The Council's position on the matter is unchanged, and the Decision, including the project to which the Honourable Member refers in his question, therefore remains valid.
</p>
<p class="contents">It should also be noted that it is the Commission's task to monitor the progress of work on the trans‐European networks.

Question No 26 by Anne McIntosh (H−0059/98)</span> </span></p>
<p class="contents">Subject: The Second EC Driving Licence Directive
</p>
<p class="contents">Will the Council reconsider the Driving Licence Directive and, in particular, the impact that its provisions will have on diabetic drivers and their right to drive 3.5‐7.5 tonne vehicles?
</p>
<p class="contents">Does the Council agree that the standards imposed, under this Directive, discriminate against diabetics, causing a great deal of personal distress?
</p>
<p class="contents"><span class="italic">
<span class="italic">
Answer</span> </span></p>
<p class="contents">On 29 July 1991 the Council adopted Directive 91/439/EEC, which entered into force on 1 July 1996.
</p>
<p class="contents">Under the Directive, it is for each Member State to determine the scope of the very exceptional cases which would justify issuing or renewing a licence for persons suffering from diabetes mellitus and requiring insulin treatment. The Council would point out that it is not for it to adopt a position on whether the Community provisions in question should be amended, as any initiative relating to the specific question put by the Honourable Member falls to the Commission.
</p>
<p class="contents">It should be noted that Directive 97/26/EC set up a Committee on Driving Licences to assist the Commission in adapting to scientific and technical progress, inter alia, Annex III and in particular the ‚minimum standards’ of physical and mental fitness for driving a power‐driven vehicle.
</p>
<p class="contents">The Council would also point out that the Directive does not discriminate against certain diseases, as Annex III specifies most diseases which could affect driving. The diseases not specified there fall within the scope of the Directive under the general provision contained in Annex III.

Question No 27 by Hans Lindqvist (H−0061/98)</span></span></p>
<p class="contents">Subject: Dental amalgam
</p>
<p class="contents">In 1986, the Swedish Board of Health and Welfare classified amalgam as a toxicologically unsuitable material for dental repairs and the Ministry of Health and Social Affairs ruled that it should cease to be used for children in 1995 and adults in 1997.
</p>
<p class="contents">Various pressure groups, non cost‐neutral pricing by the Swedish Social Insurance Board and sheer reluctance to change ingrained methods etc. have held up the phasing‐out process. EU rules on medical materials have caused further difficulties. The EU has set up an ad hoc group which has drawn up a draft evaluation of amalgam, the entire content of which has obviously been dictated by the advocates of amalgam. No representatives of patients' organizations or organizations representing researchers and dentists who have realized the harmfulness of amalgam have been allowed to take part.
</p>
<p class="contents">What is the Council's view of Sweden's being able to maintain its ban on the use of amalgam in the future?

<p class="contents">The ad hoc group, which drew up the draft evaluation of dental amalgam the Member referred to in his question, is apparently a group set up by the Commission.

Question No 29 by Maj Theorin (H−0076/98)</span> </span></p>
<p class="contents">Subject: Kurdish refugees
</p>
<p class="contents">At the beginning of this year, many people have fled from Turkey to the European Union. Turkey has come under intense pressure from the EU to stem the flow of refugees and, as a result, has carried out mass arrests of people suspected of planning to flee the country.
</p>
<p class="contents">Does the Council think it reasonable to criticize Turkey for failing to respect human rights whilst the EU, instead of giving protection to refugees from Turkey, is urging Turkey to stop them leaving the country?
</p>
<p class="contents"><span class="italic">
<span class="italic">
Answer</span> </span></p>
<p class="contents">The Council recognizes that a key element in tackling the problem of the influx of migrants from Iraq and the neighbouring region is to establish effective cooperation with the Turkish government. This point is clearly spelled out in the Presidency's 46‐Point EU Action Plan on the Influx of Migrants adopted by the General Affairs Council on 26 January.
</p>
<p class="contents">Action Point No (B) 2 of the Plan states that the Presidency, with the Commission, will take forward discussions with the Turkish government with the aim of identifying and implementing specific means of improved co‐operation.
</p>
<p class="contents">The Council will continue to give humanitarian concerns their proper weight in responding to the influx of illegal migrants, and the Action Plan highlights the importance of the Presidency's close collaboration with the UNHCR. Member States must also ensure that they continue to provide protection in accordance with international law. But equally the procedures for seeking and granting asylum should not be open to abuse. Member States also recognize the need to address the involvement of organized crime in the trafficking of illegal immigrants.
</p>
<p class="contents">While the Council recognizes the difficulties Turkey faces in tackling the issue of illegal migrants, and welcomes the co‐operation that the Turkish government has offered to date, the Council will continue to urge Turkey to improve its general record on human rights. The questions of Turkey's human rights standards and the respect of its minorities are key elements in the future development of relations between the EU and the Turkey, as indicated by the Luxembourg Council Conclusions of 13 December 1997.

Question No 30 by David Thomas (H−0077/98)</span> </span></p>
<p class="contents">Subject: Agenda 2000 and food safety
</p>
<p class="contents">The EU is preparing for significant structural changes via the 'Agenda 2000' process which will, inter alia, bring about important changes in food production. Assuming ratification of the draft Amsterdam Treaty, is it not desirable, as part of the process of bringing Europe closer to its citizens, to bring about significant improvements in cooperation on food safety, public health, occupational health and information on lifestyle? How does the Council envisage progress towards this parallel 'Agenda 2000' for the good health of European citizens?
</p>
<p class="contents"><span class="italic">
<span class="italic">
Answer</span> </span></p>
<p class="contents">The Council agrees with the Honourable Member of the European Parliament on the necessity to promote significant improvement in cooperation on food safety, public health and information on lifestyle, it stresses the fact that the Treaty of Amsterdam contains a revised Article 129a that, once the Treaty has entered into force, should contribute to the completion of such an objective.
</p>
<p class="contents">Regarding the idea of a parallel ‚Agenda 2000’ for the good health of European citizens, the Council underlines the fact that the competence to present such a proposal belongs to the Commission. Nevertheless, the Council regularly reaffirms its concerns on these matters on the occasion of the discussion of the several propositions of directive under its examination at present.

Question No 31 by Clive Needle (H−0078/98)</span> </span></p>
<p class="contents">Subject: Clinical trials of pharmaceutical products
</p>
<p class="contents">Does the Council agree that transparent clinical trials of pharmaceutical products is necessary at EU level both for the effective safe operation of the internal market and for good health? What progress is being made this year to achieve this?
</p>
<p class="contents"><span class="italic">
<span class="italic">
Answer</span> </span></p>
<p class="contents">With the introduction of the first Community legislation concerning pharmaceuticals in 1965, twin principles of protection of public health and free movement of pharmaceutical products were established. The legislation passed in that year requires that medicinal products must have a marketing authorization prior to being placed on the market in the European Union. Further, the criteria upon which access to the market is determined – quality, safety and efficacy – have been clearly set out. Particularly the latter two criteria generally have to rely on clinical trials in human subjects for demonstration purposes.
</p>
<p class="contents">The standards for the conduct of clinical trials have been developed progressively, both within the European Union and internationally. These standards were codified in the European Union guideline on Good Clinical Practice (GCP) in 1990 and are followed in clinical research by the pharmaceutical industry.
</p>
<p class="contents">Since January 1997, the internationally harmonized GCP have been incorporated into clinical practice within the European Union by virtue of their inclusion in 'The rules governing medicinal products in the European Union' published by the Commission in accordance with the annex to Directive 75/318/EEC on the approximation of the laws of Member States relating to analytical, pharmacotoxicological and clinical standards and protocols in respect of the testing of medicinal products, as amended.
</p>
<p class="contents">Since such guidelines are not binding, the harmonized legislative framework at European Union level will assure the same level of patient protection and scientific standards as well as a simplification of administrative and regulatory requirements for companies which intend to conduct multi‐centre clinical trials in more than one Member State of the European Union.
</p>
<p class="contents">The Council therefore welcomes the draft proposal presented last autumn by the Commission which aims at harmonizing procedures for the commencement of clinical trials.
</p>
<p class="contents">All Member States have their own arrangements relating to the commencement of a clinical trial. However, the requirements are not the same and thus, currently, if the trial is conducted in multiple investigational sites, the same trial must comply with different national provisions resulting in delays of up to several months. As major pharmaceutical innovations rely, for the demonstration of safety and efficacy, on multi‐centre clinical trials, it is important that clinical research should not be inhibited by unnecessary administrative burdens.
</p>
<p class="contents">Equally important, the information to be submitted to Member States prior to commencement of a clinical trial will be harmonized, both in content and format, in order to ensure that all Member States receive the same information. Included, as part of this information, are the necessary toxicological and pharmacological tests in animals performed as a pre‐determination of risk for human health.
</p>
<p class="contents">Another aspect of the draft proposal concerns harmonization of the application of the Good Clinical Practice. The draft proposal contains a delegation of power to the Commission to adopt a Directive containing the detailed principles and guidelines in Good Clinical Practice which meets the agreement of the Council.
</p>
<p class="contents">The Council welcomes also that the draft proposal provides for continuous information on clinical trials to be available to all competent authorities of the Member States. Thus, selected elements of the initial application, as well as amendments of the trial along with the summary notification at the end of the trial, whether this is due to an early interruption of the trial or in line with the anticipated duration, would be registered in a database, accessible only to competent authorities.
</p>
<p class="contents">The importance which the Council attaches to the subject of the conduct of clinical trials in the European Union is underlined by the fact that the Luxembourg Presidency started discussions on the draft proposal at expert level directly after its reception and that already two further meetings of the responsible working party have taken place in January. The objective of the United Kingdom Presidency is to advance work as far as possible.

Does the Council agree that, in the light of yet another incident at Sellafield involving a leak at that nuclear plant, the only authorization that should be given to BNFL and Sellafield is for its immediate and permanent closure?
</p>
<p class="contents"><span class="italic">
<span class="italic">
Joint Answer</span> </span></p>
<p class="contents">In reply to the questions put by the Honourable Member, I would like to stress that the Council shares the views of the Honourable Member on the importance of non proliferation in the nuclear field and can assure her that this preoccupation is always kept in mind when the Council deals with nuclear issues.
</p>
<p class="contents">In this context, the Council agrees that security control is essential and would point out that the MOX plants situated in the territory of the Member States of the European Union are subject to current Community legislation on security controls, in particular provisions of Chapter 7 of the Euratom Treaty dealing with safeguards.
</p>
<p class="contents">More generally, the Council wishes to point out that control and safeguards measures on the manufacture of MOX are applied at national, Community and international level.
</p>
<p class="contents">The Council attaches great importance to the protection of the public against the dangers arising from ionizing radiation. In 1996, a new Council Directive 96/29/Euratom (the Basic Safety Standards Directive) reinforcing the level of protection of workers and the general public was adopted. This Directive lays down strict limits of exposure to radiation taking into account the latest scientific and technological data.
</p>
<p class="contents">In this context, discharges are subject to authorization, given by the Member State concerned, which shall specify compliance with the provisions of the 1996 Directive laying down basic safety standards on the matter. In particular, doses resulting from discharges should be as low as reasonably achievable.
</p>
<p class="contents">The Council considers that strict compliance with the provisions of the Basic Safety Standards Directive should ensure for a normal operation at any nuclear plant.

<p class="contents"><span class="italic">
<span class="italic">
Answer</span> </span></p>
<p class="contents">Whilst recalling that it is on the Commission the Treaty confers the power to make proposals, the Council emphasizes at all times the need to ensure that environmental concerns are taken into consideration in all areas of EU policy making, in particular by achieving integration between environment and transport policies.
</p>
<p class="contents">Improving air quality is an important issue for the Council and a central part of the Presidency's environmental objectives. Council is currently considering the Commission's proposals for Directives relating to limit values for sulphur dioxide, oxides of nitrogen, particulate matter and lead in ambient air; the sulphur content of certain liquid fuels; and measures to be taken against air pollution by emissions from motor vehicles (light commercial vehicles). Council also adopted Conclusions on a Community strategy to combat acidification on 16 December 1997.
</p>
<p class="contents">Moreover, the attention of the Honourable Member is drawn to the fact that in recognition of the important synergies between environmental and transport measures, especially in improving air quality, the Council intends to hold a joint session of Environment and Transport Ministers in June 1998.

Question No 35 by Ulf Holm (H−0089/98)</span> </span></p>
<p class="contents">Subject: Marketing meat in non‐Community countries
</p>
<p class="contents">On 20 January the Council of Ministers of Agriculture decided to promote the consumption of high quality beef by continuing to co‐finance production at 60 %, publicizing the new meat labelling system and marketing EU meat in non‐Community countries.
</p>
<p class="contents">It is extraordinary that the EU should thus be subsidizing the sale of beef out of public funds, but this is regrettable not only on economic grounds. These measures will also in part maintain the over production of meat within the EU, and the dumping of our meat in non‐Community countries will eliminate local producers which is likely to impoverish those countries and increase their dependency on imports.
</p>
<p class="contents">How will the Council compensate the non‐Community countries for the damage they will suffer with the elimination of their local producers?
</p>
<p class="contents"><span class="italic">
<span class="italic">
Answer</span> </span></p>
<p class="contents">On 20 January 1998, the Council held a discussion on a proposal from the Commission concerning measures to promote consumption of Community quality beef and veal. The Council did not make any final decisions at that meeting.
</p>
<p class="contents">It can be noted, however, that the Commission has proposed changes to the existing measures (Regulation (EC) N° 2067/92) as well as the introduction of two new measures. The new measures concern publicity for the new labelling system adopted by the Council in 1997 (Regulation (EC) n° 820/97) and promotional activities for Community beef in third countries.
</p>
<p class="contents">Without prejudice to the outcome of the Council deliberations, I note in particular that the new measures proposed do not envisage that the Community would sell beef directly or that it would subsidize the sale of beef in third countries, but rather that it would part‐finance suitable promotional measures to promote Community quality beef and veal in third countries.

<p class="contents">As the honourable Members of Parliament know, the human rights situation in China is an issue of constant concern for the Union. All EU Member States share a common objective in wanting to achieve a tangible improvement in human rights in China.
</p>
<p class="contents">The issue of human rights is constantly on the agenda in the contacts between the Union, its individual Member States and China. I myself addressed these issues with my Chinese counterpart when I was in Beijing this January.
</p>
<p class="contents">Since last year's Commission on Human Rights, the EU and China have engaged in a series of substantial discussions on human rights. Two meetings at experts level took place last year, one in October in Luxembourg and a second one in Beijing early December. Another meeting of this kind is to take place in the margins of a joint EU/China seminar in Beijing at the end of February on the protection of human rights and the administration of justice. A further round of talks is most likely to take place in London next May.

<span class="italic">
Joint Answer</span> </span></p>
<p class="contents">I agree with the honourable Parliamentarians, both that the appalling total of 18 million unemployed people across the European Union is an atrocious waste of human and economic resources and that improving the skills of Europe's workers is a key part of the action we must take to tackle the problem.
</p>
<p class="contents">The New Employment Chapter in the Treaty agreed at the Amsterdam European Council and the Conclusions of that Council, along with the Employment Guidelines adopted at the extraordinary European Council on Employment: on 15 December 1997 have given a new and substantial impetus to the Community's work on employment matters.
</p>
<p class="contents">The Luxembourg Council agreed, inter alia, upon an overall strategy involving the co‐ordination of Member State's employment policies and a process involving the preparation of national action plans, their analysis by the Council and exchanges of good practice, in particular through the Employment and Labour Market Committee.

<p class="contents">With regard to the proposal for changes to the common organization of the market in bananas, the Commission has repeatedly stated that the proposal is only one option open to the EU at a response to the findings of the WTO Panel.
</p>
<p class="contents">Is the Council satisfied that the option proposed by the Commission is indeed the most valid one, and could the Council comment on whether it is looking at other options and, if so, what those options entail?

<span class="italic">
Answer</span> </span></p>
<p class="contents">Following the World Trade Organization's findings on the compatibility of the market organization for bananas with WTO rules, the Commission presented to the Council, on 16 January 1998, its Proposal for a Council Regulation amending the present Regulation No 404/93 on the common organization of the market in bananas.
</p>
<p class="contents">The proposal is presently under examination by the Council. Therefore you will understand that it is too early for me to speculate on the possible outcome of this examination and to anticipate on the final position of the Council. Moreover, I observe that, in finalizing its position, the Council will wish to be aware of the opinions of both the European Parliament and the Economic and Social Committee, once these have been received.
</p>
<p class="contents">On your wider point, I would mention that the consolidation and strengthening of the multilateral system remains one of the main priorities of the Council in the field of external economic relations.

Question No 42 by Karl Habsburg‐Lothringen (H−0110/98)</span> </span></p>
<p class="contents">Subject: Creation of an artificial region called the 'West Balkans'
</p>
<p class="contents">Is it true that the Council has decided to create a region in Europe which will be called the 'West Balkans' and consist of Albania, Serbia and Montenegro, Macedonia, Bosnia‐Hercegovina and Croatia? Does the Council realize that, if it were to do so, it would be flagrantly flying in the face of history and the will of broad sections of the population? Is the Council aware that, for example, Croatia has always been, and still is, historically and culturally a western‐oriented Central European state and that such facts cannot be blithely ignored in a supremely imperialistic manner?
</p>
<p class="contents"><span class="italic">
<span class="italic">
Answer</span> </span></p>
<p class="contents">The change in denomination of the Council ‚Working Group on Former Yugoslavia’ to the Council ‚Western Balkans Working Group’ is due to the following reasons, which are merely administrative and not political: 
</p>
<p class="contents">1) in the majority of Ministries of Foreign Affairs in EU capitals, experts who deal with Albania are also those who deal with former Yugoslavia. It was therefore logical and cost‐effective to treat the countries in the same Group.
</p>
<p class="contents">2) Albania, Bosnia‐Herzegovina, Croatia, Former Republic of Yugoslavia (FRY), Former Yugoslav Republic of Macedonia (FYROM) are all covered by the EU regional approach and conditionality policy. They should thus be treated together.
</p>

Question No 43 by Anne Van Lancker (H−0113/98)</span> </span></p>
<p class="contents">Subject: Preparations for integrating the Schengen acquis in the Treaty
</p>
<p class="contents">According to the Treaty, the Schengen measures on checks at external borders, asylum, immigration and judicial cooperation in civil matters should come under Title IV of the Treaty establishing the European Community, while the provisions on police and judicial cooperation in criminal matters should come under Title VI of the Treaty on European Union, the third pillar. What should the SIS (and later the EIS) come under? Article 286 of the Treaty says that from 1 January 1999 Community decisions on the protection of individuals with regard to the processing and free movement of personal data shall apply to the institutions and bodies set up by, or on the basis of, the Treaty. What arrangements will there be for the protection of privacy in the SIS?

<span class="italic">
Answer</span> </span></p>
<p class="contents">According to Article 2, paragraph 1 of the Protocol in the Treaty of Amsterdam integrating the Schengen acquis into the framework of the European Union, the Council has to determine, in conformity with the relevant provisions of the Treaties, the legal basis for each of the provisions or decisions which constitute the Schengen acquis.
</p>
<p class="contents">In order to prepare a Council decision to that effect, which will be taken when the Treaty of Amsterdam will enter into force, a working group of the Council has been set up, which had its first meetings under the Luxembourg presidency, and is presently continuing its work under the UK presidency.

<p class="contents">The Commission's answer to question No 56 (H−0860/97)<a href="#def_12_1" name="ref_12_1"><sup>(1)</sup></a>

, in which I criticized its proposal amending European Parliament and Council Directive 95/2/EC<a href="#def_12_2" name="ref_12_2"><sup>(2)</sup></a>

 for being incomprehensible, was that it did not share my opinion that the proposal was incomprehensible but would be pleased to answer any technical questions that I might have about the proposal.
</p>
<p class="contents">Does the UK Presidency share the Commission's views on this Directive, which has been amended many times over the years? Does it consider the Directive to be well suited for ensuring public participation and for restoring contact between the peoples of Europe and the European Union, which are amongst the aims stated by the Presidency in its work programme?
</p>
<p class="contents">Given that the Directive in question actually affects many people quite directly, since they suffer allergic reactions to additives, could the Council envisage using it as a kind of test case to establish whether EU legislation is understandable or could be made more understandable to a wider audience?

<p class="contents"><span class="italic">
<span class="italic">
Answer</span> </span></p>
<p class="contents">The interesting question which the Honourable Member raises, concern a case of clarifying the details of a proposal amending an existing legislative text, which therefore already applies and has already been subject to one minor amendment.
</p>
<p class="contents">It is clear that the text in question, since it relates to food additives, is bound to show a certain degree of technical complexity, hence the offer made by the Commission in its reply to Question H−860/97, to which the Honourable Member refers in her present question to the Council.
</p>
<p class="contents">Furthermore, I should like to confirm to the Honourable Member that the European Union is in fact involved in a process aiming to reduce the distance between European citizens and the Community whilst offering greater transparency in these texts and procedures. In this respect I would like to emphasize efforts made through the codification of existing texts as provided for in the Interinstitutional Agreement of 1994 setting up on an accelerated working method for codification. This consists in replacing a legislative act which has been amended several times by a single codified text, without changing its substance. Simplification of existing texts is also a concern which is being addressed in the present directive. As to the specific question of the Honourable Member it is difficult to answer because she does not indicate what are the obscure points in the Commission's proposal which, to her mind, call for an explanation.

<p class="contents">Can the Council Presidency indicate what representations for clemency it has made or is planning to make on behalf of Zoleykhah Kadkhoda, a twenty‐year old Iranian woman who was sentenced to death last year for engaging in sexual relations outside marriage.
</p>
<p class="contents">Immediately after the sentence was pronounced, Zoleykhah was taken out to be stoned to death. The sentence was carried out. Zoleykhah was then taken to a mortuary but miraculously began to breathe. She was taken to hospital where she has been recovering from her injuries.

Answer</span> </span></p>
<p class="contents">The Council has no specific knowledge of the case raised by the Honourable Member, but it does call on all countries to abolish the death penalty and shares the Honourable Member's abhorrence of cruel and inhumane practices such as stoning.
</p>
<p class="contents">There is unfortunately little the Council, or individual Member States, can do to influence other countries' legal systems and practices. But the Council does raise both general and specific human rights issue with Iran and other countries that violate human rights and standards which we hold to be universal.

<p class="contents">The end of the EU‐Iran Critical Dialogue in the wake of the so‐called Mykonos trial limited further our modest possibilities of influencing Iranian behaviour in the area of human rights; the Council, however, hopes that this situation will improve, following the new Iranian Government's stated commitment to respect the rule of law and their emphasis on the need for a dialogue of civilizations.

<p class="contents">1. 
In reply to the question put by Mrs Hulthén, I wish to state that the Council is not competent for the matter referred to by the Honourable Member of Parliament.

</p>
<p class="contents">2. 
In reply to the question of Mr Crowley it should be pointed out that the Member States and the Commission have been actively coordinating their positions and taken common stands in preparatory meetings for the special General Assembly Session on drugs from 8/10 June 1998 in New York. The suggestions of the European Union in regard to precursors, synthetic drugs, money laundering, demand reduction and alternative development have been largely taken into account in papers resulting from these preparatory meetings that were held in July, October and December 1997 in Vienna.

</p>
<p class="contents">A preparatory meeting for the special General Assembly Session on drugs, will take place on 16/20 March 1998 in Vienna. At this meeting prior attention will be given to the political declaration which suggests to eradicate poppy and coca cultivation before 2008. Member States and Commission are coordinating their positions in competent Council bodies. These bodies are also examining a communication from the Commission to the Council and the European Parliament with a view to establishing a common European Union platform for the special session of the UN General Assembly on International cooperation in the fight against drugs.
</p>
<p class="contents">In general it can be said that the integrated transpillar approach of the Union in regard to drugs is reflected in documents resulting from preparatory meetings.

Question No 51 by Concepció Ferrer (H−0135/98)</span> </span></p>
<p class="contents">Subject: Situation in Equatorial Guinea
</p>
<p class="contents">The still obscure recent events on the island of Bioko (Equatorial Guinea) have led to claims by the local democratic opposition that members of the Bubi ethnic group have been arrested and tortured, while the threat of the death penalty still hangs over four former Spanish ex‐legionaries of Equatorial Guinean origin.
</p>
<p class="contents">In view of the above, has the Council established the real impact of the events, and can it state how far the accusations of major human rights violations by the government are backed up by the facts? Is the Council aware that four Spanish citizens of Equatorial Guinean origin are under arrest?
</p>
<p class="contents">Should the accusations prove to be true, what measures does it intend to adopt to bolster the national democratization process promoted by President Obiang?
</p>
<p class="contents"><span class="italic">
<span class="italic">
Answer</span> </span></p>
<p class="contents">The Council is aware of reports that a number of people belonging to the Bubi ethnic group native to Bioko Island, one of the two parts of Equatorial Guinea have been under arrest since 21 January, suspected of belonging to or supporting the independence movement (Movimento para la Autodeterminacion de la Isla de Bioko (MAIB)). The Equatorial Guinean Government has accused MAIB of attacking military and civilian targets on Bioko. On 5 February the Minister of Foreign Affairs, Mr Oyono is reported to have confirmed that several people had been arrested. Among those arrested were one Nigerian and four Spaniards of Equatorial Guinean origin, all alleged to be MAIB members. Mr Oyono confirmed that they faced the death penalty. MAIB is reported to have denied all charges of being behind these attacks or other acts of violence. It claims that more than 800 of the Bubi people
<span class="bold">
 have </span>been arrested.
</p>
<p class="contents">The Council will continue to monitor developments in Equatorial Guinea and will raise its concerns about human rights in Equatorial Guinea in its report to the 1998 UN Commission on Human rights. President Obiang visited the Commission on 30 October 1997 to present his programme for democratisation and to request a resumption of aid that was suspended in 1992. The Commission responded that the progressive resumption of aid would be linked to progress achieved in respect for human rights, democratic principles and the rule of law.

This time 'persons unknown' broke into the Church of the Annunciation and looted icons, holy vessels and the tomb in the church.
</p>
<p class="contents">Orthodox religious monuments in Turkey and the occupied northern sector of Cyprus are constantly being looted and no‐one has ever been arrested at any time. Will the Council, therefore, take account of this widespread phenomenon and take steps to ensure that the Turkish authorities assume their responsibilities?
</p>
<p class="contents"><span class="italic">
<span class="italic">
Answer</span> </span></p>
<p class="contents">The Council notes that under the Treaty of Peace, signed at Lausanne in July 1923, the Turkish Government undertook to grant full protection to the churches, synagogues, cemeteries, and other religious establishments of non‐Moslem minorities.
</p>
<p class="contents">The European Council meeting in Luxembourg on 12‐13 December 1997 again underlined the necessity for the Turkish Government to meet its fundamental obligations in the field of democracy and human rights. It recalled, in line with the council position expressed at the Association Council with Turkey on 29 April 1997, that strengthening Turkey's links with the European Union also depends on that country's pursuit of political and economic reforms, including respect for and protection of minorities.
</p>
<p class="contents">The situation of democracy and human rights in Turkey remains high on the Council's agenda. These issues are brought up virtually in all meetings with the Turkish authorities.

<p class="contents">Subject: Trade union rights
</p>
<p class="contents">At the request of the European Council Summit Meeting in Amsterdam, the Commission has drawn up a proposal for a Council Regulation introducing an intervention mechanism for the Commission to remove certain obstacles to trade.
</p>
<p class="contents">The aim is to secure freedom of movement for goods within the internal market, which is one of the Community's fundamental principles. So as to prevent infringements of the principle of freedom of movement, which may arise through requiring licences or technical certificates, stopping products by obstructing transport on motorways, at airports or ports, for instance, the Commission wishes to be able to intervene quickly and request Member States to take measures to remove the obstacles. Member States will have between three and five days to submit their views. If a Member State does not comply with the Commission's decisions, the Commission may take the matter further to the Court of Justice.
</p>
<p class="contents">The EU has no jurisdiction in this area and the Regulation is proposed on the basis of Article 235.
</p>
<p class="contents">Does the proposal imply that the Commission can force Member States to intervene in strikes and lockouts? The trade unions are highly critical of EU interference with fundamental trade union rights and intervention in trade union disputes. Does the proposal not jeopardize dialogue between the two sides of industry? How will the right to strike be guaranteed?
</p>
<p class="contents"><span class="italic">

<p class="contents">On 10 November 1997, while noting that there had been some progress, the Council concluded that Croatia had not complied with all the obligations arising from the Dayton/Paris and Erdut Agreements. Any improvement of relations, including the extension of the Phare programme and the possible beginning of talks on a trade and cooperation agreement referred to by the Honourable Parliamentarian, will therefore depend on further efforts by Croatia.

Question No 71 by Hugh McMahon (H−0067/98)</span> </span></p>
<p class="contents">Subject: EU Bathing Water Directive
</p>
<p class="contents">What discussions has the Commission had with the UK Government with a view to increasing the number of designated beaches protected under the Bathing Water Directive, and does the Commission have any plans to revise this legislation?
</p>
<p class="contents"><span class="italic">
<span class="italic">
Answer</span> </span></p>
<p class="contents">The Commission takes note of the concerns of the honourable Member about the number of identified bathing areas in the UK, and about the revision of the existing Community legislation.
</p>
<p class="contents">The identification of bathing water areas under the current Bathing Water Quality Directive 76/160/EEC is for the Member States. The Directive describes bathing areas in Article 1.2 as: ’All running or still fresh waters or parts thereof and sea water, in which a) bathing is explicitly authorized by the competent authorities of each Member State, or b) bathing is not prohibited and is traditionally practised by a large number of bathers.’. It is in particular this last phrase (traditionally practised by a LARGE NUMBER of bathers) that leaves considerable room for interpretation. The Commission believes that the local authorities are the best placed bodies to judge this and does therefore not interfere in the actual identification of those zones. Moreover, the Commission does not have, for the moment, the resources to control these identifications. The Commission only questions the identification or non‐identification of certain bathing areas if it receives convincing information about bathing activities, as described under the Directive, in particular from concerned citizens or local action groups.
</p>
<p class="contents">It must be noted that the number of identified bathing areas throughout the European Union, including in the UK, increases every year. In the UK, where only coastal areas have been identified, the number has increased from 455 in 1992 to 486 in 1997. The Commission regrets, and has said so for many years at the presentation of its annual Bathing Water Quality report, that the UK has not identified inland bathing areas.
</p>
<p class="contents">As the revision of the existing legislation is concerned, the Commission's amended proposal for the revision of the Directive on bathing water quality is now ready for discussion in Council pursuant to Article 189 (a) §2 of the EC Treaty. The Commission has on several occasions requested upcoming presidencies of the Council, including the present UK presidency, to take the proposal up in their agenda for discussion. The different presidencies have so far not given an indication that they will indeed discuss this proposal.

Question No 72 by Nuala Ahern (H−0083/98)</span> </span></p>
<p class="contents">Subject: Proposals by BNFL to increase radioactive discharges from the Sellafield plant
</p>
<p class="contents">What information has the Commission received from the United Kingdom authorities concerning BNFL proposals to increase the radioactive discharges from the Sellafield plant currently under assessment by the UK Environment Agency?
</p>
<p class="contents"><span class="italic">
<span class="italic">
Question No 73 by James Fitzsimons (H−0139/98)</span> </span></p>
<p class="contents">Subject: Authorization for increased discharges into the air at Sellafield and further nuclear leaks at Sellafield
</p>
<p class="contents">As the Commission is no doubt aware BNFL has initiated a consultation process concerning proposed changes to radioactive discharge limits at its Sellafield plant. It has applied for authorization to increase discharges into the air and to decrease but not eliminate discharges into the sea. In the light of yet another nuclear leak at Sellafield and my concern about the operations of Sellafield, which have been on the record for well over a decade, will the Commission, once and for all, intervene in this affair, and support the demands of those who have been seeking the closure of the Sellafield plant?
</p>
<p class="contents"><span class="italic">
<span class="italic">
Joint Answer</span> </span></p>
<p class="contents">Discharges from nuclear sites are regulated within strict authorizations issued by national competent authorities. Such authorizations ensure that resultant doses to members of the public not only comply with the Community Basic Safety Standards for the protection of the health of workers and the general public against the dangers arising from ionizing radiation but also that such doses are as low as reasonably achievable, the so‐called ALARA principle. It is the responsibility of Member States to ensure compliance with the Basic Safety Standards and so the revision of authorizations for the discharge of radioactive waste is a matter of national competence.
</p>
<p class="contents">Even though there is no obligation to do so, the Commission was informed by the United Kingdom authorities that a proposal to vary the Sellafield site authorizations was being considered by the competent authorities and was to go to public consultation at the end of January 1998. the Commission has received a copy of the papers prepared for public consultation and will continue to follow these matters closely.
</p>
<p class="contents">The Commission is aware of recent reports of an incident at the Sellafield site on 28 January 1998 in which two workers came into contact with radioactive dust. BNFL is investigating the incident in parallel with the United Kingdom authorities and the results of the investigation are to be published. The incident has been temporarily classified as Level One, the lowest level on the International Nuclear Event Scale of One to Seven. The Commission understands that there was no release of radioactivity into the environment. Consequently, no member of the public was at risk.
</p>
<p class="contents">As guardians of the Euratom Treaty, the Commission would intervene only if there was evidence that the United Kingdom was not enforcing its responsibilities under that Treaty. The Commission has no basis, therefore, for action of the type proposed.

Question No 74 by Carmen Díez de Rivera Icaza (H−0101/98)</span> </span></p>
<p class="contents">Subject: Funicular railway inside the Picos de Europa National Park
</p>
<p class="contents">Is the Commission aware of the decision taken in Spain by the Asturias regional government concerning the forthcoming construction of a funicular railway inside the Picos de Europa National Park in order to provide access to the town of Bulnes? In the Commission's view, does this constitute compliance with Directive 92/43/EEC on the conservation of natural habitats and of wild fauna and flora<a href="#def_12_4" name="ref_12_4"><sup>(4)</sup></a>

, Directive 79/409/EEC on the conservation of wild birds<a href="#def_12_5" name="ref_12_5"><sup>(5)</sup></a>

 and Directive 85/337/EEC on environmental impact assessment<a href="#def_12_6" name="ref_12_6"><sup>(6)</sup></a>

?
</p>
<p class="contents"><span class="italic">
<span class="italic">
Answer</span> </span></p>
<p class="contents">The Commission's attention has already been drawn to certain projects, which could affect the ‚Picos de Europa’ national park, in written question 2506/97 by Mrs González Álvarez and others.
</p>
<p class="contents">The Commission would like to say that the Spanish authorities have classified part of the national park as a Special Protection Area for birds, in accordance with Article 4 of Council Directive 79/409/EEC of 2 April 1979 on the conservation of wild birds<a href="#def_12_7" name="ref_12_7"><sup>(7)</sup></a>

. The official name of the Special Protection Area is ‚Montaña de Covadonga’.
</p>
<p class="contents">Having said this, it is necessary to point out that although the village of Bulnes is nearby, it is not situated within the ‚Montaña de Covadonga’ Special Protection Area. The Commission does not have any information to suggest that the funicular railway project is likely to be harmful to the Special Protection Area.
</p>
<p class="contents">On the other hand, the village of Bulnes is situated in an area Spain proposes to include in the Natura 2000 network, under Council Directive 92/43/EEC of 21 May 1992 on the conservation of natural habitats and of wild fauna and flora<a href="#def_12_8" name="ref_12_8"><sup>(8)</sup></a>

.
</p>
<p class="contents">According to paragraphs 2, 3 and 4 of Article 6 of Directive 92/43/EEC, Member States must take the appropriate steps to prevent the deterioration of natural habitats and habitats of species, and to prevent the disturbance of species for which the areas have been designated, inasmuch as such disturbances are likely to have a significant effect on the objectives of the directive.
</p>
<p class="contents">The above‐mentioned provisions will not be applicable however until the list of sites of Community importance constituting a coherent ecological network of special areas of conservation called ‚Natura 2000’ is established by the Commission.
</p>
<p class="contents">Furthermore, funicular railways are not listed in the categories of projects, for which environmental impact assessment is obligatory according to Directive 85/337/EEC on environmental impact assessment<a href="#def_12_9" name="ref_12_9"><sup>(9)</sup></a>

.
</p>
<p class="contents">Nevertheless, the Commission has contacted the Spanish authorities to ask them to adopt the necessary measures to ensure that the project is not harmful to the environment.

Question No 77 by Ole Krarup (H−0014/98)</span> </span></p>
<p class="contents">Subject: EIB loan for the construction of the A4 motorway in Poland
</p>
<p class="contents">It is astonishing that projects designed to connect eastern and central Europe to the TENs and partly financed by the EIB disregard their adverse impact on the environment and health.
</p>
<p class="contents">For example, the planned A4 motorway in Poland, part of the TENs extension scheme, will cut through the centre of the heavily polluted city of Katowice in Silesia, and its route will also affect some of the last remaining recreational areas in Upper Silesia as well as pass 100 m from a recently built housing estate which has some 10 000 residents.
</p>
<p class="contents">The EIB has not been very open about a number of TENs projects in eastern and central Europe. Members of the CEE‐Bankwatch Network have sought in vain to have specific environmental impact analyses carried out for various infrastructure projects in respect of which the EIB has granted loans, and their organization has, for instance, had far more fruitful dialogue with both the World Bank and the ERBD.
</p>
<p class="contents">What steps will the Commission take to safeguard the interests of the public in eastern and central Europe in ensuring that environmental factors are taken into account when the EIB grants loans for infrastructure projects?
</p>
<p class="contents"><span class="italic">
<span class="italic">
Answer</span> </span></p>
<p class="contents">The Government of Poland has embarked on an ambitious investment programme for the construction of approximately 2600 km of toll motorways to be built over the next twenty years. Co‐financing from Phare and the International Financing Institutions is provided to support this programme.
</p>
<p class="contents">It goes without saying that all construction will take full account of the need to protect, and where possible, to improve the environment. The Commission feels that the Polish Government has adequate legal safeguards to assess the environmental impact<a href="#def_12_10" name="ref_12_10"><sup>(10)</sup></a>

.
</p>
<p class="contents">In particular you should note that full environmental impact assessments are carried out prior to the decision on the location of motorways and, therefore, prior to the provision of EIB loans and Phare co‐financing. In the case of A4‐motorway, the decision on its route through the agglomeration of Katowice was based on a wide consultation of all relevant bodies. It needs to be underlined that the motorway will not cross the city centre of Katowice but will by‐pass it. Therefore, it will improve the environment, the circulation and the road safety in the city centre by diverting the traffic from it. In addition, since Katowice is a densely populated area, the construction of the motorway will naturally include environmental protection facilities including noise barriers and the drainage of surface water in conformity with the environmental standards required for city areas.
</p>
<p class="contents">Where Phare co‐financing is provided, the Commission carefully examines the environmental impact reports for such works prior to taking any funding decision. This is currently even more important given that major investments in infrastructure, notably transport and environment, have been defined as priorities for the pre‐accession strategy. In conclusion, you should note that the draft Accession Partnership puts a special emphasis on transposing all environmental directives.
</p>
<p class="contents">With regard to the involvement of EIB in the motorway construction programme, the Commission has proposed the same approach thus requiring the beneficiary to provide the necessary environmental impact assessment as a pre‐condition for the decision on a loan.

Question No 78 by Nikitas Kaklamanis (H−0023/98)</span> </span></p>
<p class="contents">Subject: Savage murder and arson attack against a chapel in Istanbul
</p>
<p class="contents">On 12 January, a number of unknown persons entered the chapel of Aghios Therapontos in Istanbul which harbours the well with the holy water, savagely murdered the guardian of the chapel and the holy well and threw the corpse down the well.
</p>
<p class="contents">They then set fire to the chapel and stole the icons and the holy vessels, as the Turkish Police who found the corpse of the murdered guard later confirmed.
</p>
<p class="contents">This is the second such incident and follows the bomb attack against the Oecumenical Patriarchate in Istanbul a short time ago, which illustrates the steadily escalating acts of provocation by Turks against the Greek minority and against the Churches and ecclesiastical monuments and confirms that all these terrorist actions take place with the undoubted connivance of the Turkish authorities, if not with their active encouragement.
</p>
<p class="contents">Does the Commission intend to impress on Turkey, a country bound by an association agreement with the European Union, not by words and pious wishes but by very specific actions, the need to respect its international obligations, and notably to protect its minorities in general and to respect religious relics and holy places?
</p>
<p class="contents"><span class="italic">
<span class="italic">
Answer</span> </span></p>
<p class="contents">The Commission deplores the serious incident against the Greek Orthodox Church of St. Therapontos in Istanbul, last January. The Turkish authorities have started an investigation. The initial information obtained appears to indicate that this was a criminal act, its main motive being the theft of valuables.
</p>
<p class="contents">In all contacts with the Turkish authorities, the Commission emphasizes the importance of improving the human rights situation and continuing the democratization process in Turkey. Despite Ankara's recent decision to suspend the political dialogue with the European Union for the time being, the Commission intends to continue to make its concern known to its interlocutors with regard to these issues.
</p>
<p class="contents">The European Council held in Luxembourg in December 1997 reiterated that the strengthening of the links between Turkey and the European Union was also dependent upon the continuation of the political and economic reforms Turkey has started to introduce, particularly in terms of bringing human rights standards and practices in Turkey into line without those in the European Union. The Council added that it is also dependent upon the respect and protection of minorities.

Question No 79 by Konstantinos Hatzidakis (H−0028/98)</span> </span></p>
<p class="contents">Subject: Progress of pre‐accession negotiations on Cyprus
</p>
<p class="contents">Pre‐accession negotiations between the European Union and Cyprus are due to begin on 30 March 1998. It has been repeatedly stressed that accession must benefit both communities on the island. Given that it has been decided to launch an information campaign concerning the benefits to be expected from the accession of the whole of Cyprus to the European Union, will the Commission say what specific measures have been taken so far in this connection and what other actions it intends to take in the immediate future? Given also that the Turkish‐Cypriot leader, Rauf Denktash, recently prohibited Turkish Cypriots from taking part in meetings of groups seeking to bring about a rapprochement between the two communities, can the Commission say whether it intends to take steps to have this ban lifted?
</p>
<p class="contents"><span class="italic">
<span class="italic">
Answer</span> </span></p>
<p class="contents">The General Affairs Council of 6 March 1995 invited the Commission to undertake an information strategy in consultation with the Cypriot Government, towards the Turkish Cypriot community in order to explain the advantages it could derive from accession to the European Community.
</p>
<p class="contents">Since then, the Commission has supported a wide range of information activities involving an important number of members of the Turkish Cypriot civil society, both inside and outside Cyprus.
</p>
<p class="contents">These activities include frequent conferences, debates and contacts promoted by the Delegation of the Commission in Nicosia with Turkish Cypriot academic, trade‐union, press and business circles.
</p>
<p class="contents">Bi‐communal meetings have been actively encouraged in the island and several bi‐communal groups of young businessmen and journalists have visited institutions in Brussels in the last years.
</p>
<p class="contents">Turkish Cypriots have also participated in a seminar on Community policies and institutions in the European Institute of Public Administration in Maastricht. The Commission has strongly supported the work of Cypriot women from both communities towards peace which resulted in March last year in a conference held in Brussels under the title ‚Women speak out: give peace a chance’. There have also been several information activities addressed towards the important Cypriot community in Great Britain.
</p>
<p class="contents">Besides all these events, the Commission delegation in Cyprus distributes once a month a newsletter to different opinion relays in the north of Cyprus and has made available translations into Turkish of Community information brochures dealing with the main Community policies, decision‐making procedures and institutions.
</p>
<p class="contents">The Commission is aware of recent difficulties concerning the continuation of bi‐communal meetings and continues to impress on all partners concerned the need to pursue these contacts in order to improve mutual trust and confidence.

Question No 80 by Sören Wibe (H−0031/98)</span> </span></p>
<p class="contents">Subject: Kurdish refugees from Turkey
</p>
<p class="contents">In view of the situation that has arisen after a number of Kurdish refugees recently reached Italy, will the Commission say whether it is having talks with the Turkish government about what is causing those refugees to try to get into EU Member States?
</p>
<p class="contents">Has it pointed out to the Turkish government that, in the long term, it is not tougher border controls but only greater respect for human rights, e.g. respect for the Kurdish minority's liberties and rights in Turkey, that will stem the tide of refugees?
</p>
<p class="contents"><span class="italic">
<span class="italic">
Answer</span> </span></p>
<p class="contents">The recent influx of people from Iraq, Turkey and neighbouring areas is not a new phenomenon. For several years, Member States have accepted and are continuing to accept several thousand people from those regions.
</p>
<p class="contents">In 1995, the Commission proposed to establish cooperation between the European Union and Turkey in the fields of justice and home affairs. The Association Council therefore set up an institutional framework in the same year. It provides in particular for regular meetings within the scope of the K4 Committee, composed of senior officials and ministers. Political reasons have prevented the implementation of this system.
</p>
<p class="contents">Furthermore, the communication of 15 July 1997 on the future of relations with Turkey, whose substance was approved by the Luxembourg European Council, provides for the financing of cooperation in the field of justice and home affairs, with regard to immigration and the prevention of organized crime, in particular. These activities will fall within the scope of the Community budget, either under the MEDA programme, or by means of special financial cooperation amounting to ECU 375 million, when the Council has approved it.
</p>
<p class="contents">The recent influx has many complicated causes. Further analysis is necessary. With regard to the influx of people from Turkey, although their decisions may also have been based on economic reasons, it is certain that the long‐term conflict in south‐east Turkey has contributed towards the movements of the population and the deterioration of the economic situation in the area.
</p>
<p class="contents">The Luxembourg European Council asked for a plan of action to be prepared in order to find a solution to this problem. The General Affairs Council approved the plan on 26 January. Detailed analysis of the causes of the recent influx is one of the actions to be implemented. The plan of action also provides for discussions to be held between the Presidency and the Commission, and the Turkish authorities.
</p>
<p class="contents">The plan of action includes measures relating to the first and second pillars (detailed study of causes, contacts with Turkey, humanitarian aid in the region) and measures relating to the third pillar, with regard to the right of asylum, the implementation of the Dublin Convention, the prevention of illegal immigration and police cooperation against illegal immigration channels.
</p>
<p class="contents">In Agenda 2000, the Commission emphasized the need for a civilian rather than a military solution to the problems in south‐east Turkey. The Luxembourg European Council stated that the strengthening of the links between Turkey and the European Union is also dependent upon the respect and protection of minorities.
</p>
<p class="contents">The economic and social situation in south‐east Turkey must also be improved if we wish to prevent an increase in the number of immigrants from that region. Funds are available under the MEDA programme to implement development projects in the region. To enable the funds for such actions to be released, the European Parliament's cooperation is of course very important. The Commission hopes that the problems which have so far arisen with Parliament on this subject can be resolved.

Question No 81 by Maj Theorin (H−0046/98)</span> </span></p>
<p class="contents">Subject: Turkey
</p>
<p class="contents">Amnesty International's report for 1997 and the US Congress' report for the same year reveal an alarming human rights situation in Turkey in terms both of summary executions and the number of people who have disappeared, 
</p>
<p class="contents">In early 1998, many people are fleeing from Turkey to the EU. The EU has exerted strong pressure on Turkey to halt the flow of refugees and Turkey has now arrested suspected refugees en masse.
</p>
<p class="contents">Does the Commissioner consider that there is a link between human rights shortcomings and the Kurdish refugees fleeing Turkey? Is it consistent to criticize Turkey for not satisfying human rights criteria while refugees from Turkey are not given shelter in Europe?
</p>
<p class="contents"><span class="italic">
<span class="italic">
Answer</span> </span></p>
<p class="contents">With regard to the recent influx of people from Turkey, although their decisions may also have been based on economic reasons, it is certain that the long‐term conflict in south‐east Turkey has contributed towards the movements of the population and the deterioration of the economic situation in the area.
</p>
<p class="contents">Italy has been particularly affected by the recent influx. During the urgent debate organized on this subject by the European Parliament on 14 January, the member of the Commission responsible for relations with Turkey congratulated the Italian authorities' on their attitude to this matter. They reacted to the problem in a humanitarian manner, whilst ensuring full compliance with the conventions to which Italy is a party.
</p>
<p class="contents">The Luxembourg European Council asked that a plan of action be prepared by the Council in order to find a solution to this problem.

Question No 82 by Hans Lindqvist (H−0064/98)</span></span></p>
<p class="contents">Subject: The Turkish army's campaign against the Kurds
</p>
<p class="contents">Turkey has repeatedly used a variety of threats in its attempts to gain the upper hand in its talks with the EU on possible EU membership. On the occasion of the Luxembourg Summit before Christmas Turkey threatened to withdraw its application for membership if it was not offered negotiations on the same terms as Cyprus. About a week ago the Turkish Court banned the largest party, Refah, because its religious (Muslim) orientation was a breach of the Constitution.
</p>
<p class="contents">The Turkish army's campaign against the Kurds in Kurdistan is continuing undiminished with its constant toll of human lives and burnt‐out villages, as well as the suppression of freedom of expression and human rights.

</p>
<p class="contents"><span class="italic">
<span class="italic">
Answer</span> </span></p>
<p class="contents">First of all, the Commission would like to reiterate that the recent influx of people from Iraq, Turkey and neighbouring areas, is not a new phenomenon. For several years, Member States have accepted – and are continuing to accept – several thousand people from those regions.
</p>

</p>
<p class="contents"><span class="italic">
<span class="italic">
Answer</span> </span></p>
<p class="contents">The Commission shares the view that economic crime and drug trafficking are a serious problem in central and eastern Europe.

<p class="contents">The Commission fully supports the implementation of the action plan to combat organized crime approved by the European Council of Amsterdam, and the proposed pre‐accession pact on cooperation against crime with the candidate countries.
</p>
<p class="contents">In the framework of the enhanced pre‐accession strategy and the Accession Partnerships support will be given to: institution building, including legislation and training of law enforcement bodies, justice, police and border management; anti‐money laundering measures; the fight against corruption.

Question No 84 by Doeke Eisma (H−0081/98)</span> </span></p>
<p class="contents">Subject: Priorities for environmental legislation in central and eastern Europe
</p>
<p class="contents">In paragraph 86 of its resolution (A4‐0368/97)<a href="#def_12_11" name="ref_12_11"><sup>(11)</sup></a>

 on 'Agenda 2000', Parliament called on the Commission to establish a list, in cooperation with the Council and Parliament, of the most important elements of EU environmental legislation outside the internal market which applicant countries must satisfy at the time of accession. This increases the political pressure to invest more in the environment.
</p>
<p class="contents">Can the Commission say what stage it has reached in establishing this list, and when Parliament can expect to see a proposal?
</p>
<p class="contents"><span class="italic">
<span class="italic">
Answer</span> </span></p>
<p class="contents">Full adaptation of candidate countries to the Community environmental acquis is an essential element in the accession process. Given the overall environmental situation in these countries, the financial and administrative effort for the adoption of the acquis will be considerable. Hence the importance of setting up priorities which will allow both the candidate countries to focus their efforts and the... to organize increased assistance.
</p>
<p class="contents">The ‚Accession Partnerships’, presently under preparation, outline the key short‐ and medium‐term priorities in environment for the pre‐accession period on the basis of the findings of the Opinions. (Parliament has already been informed on the principles, priorities, intermediate objectives and conditions of the Partnerships which are currently being approved by the Council)<a href="#def_12_12" name="ref_12_12"><sup>(12)</sup></a>

.
</p>
<p class="contents">Natural environmental strategies based on the Accession Partnerships will be further elaborated in the ‚National Programmes for the Adoption of the Acquis’. These will be finalized by the candidate countries during 1998, in consultation with the Commission.

Question No 85 by Karl Habsburg‐Lothringen (H−0099/98)</span> </span></p>
<p class="contents">Subject: Names of units in DG IA
</p>
<p class="contents">Is it true that the unit in DG IA responsible for Albania and the States of former Yugoslavia has been renamed the 'West Balkans' unit?
</p>
<p class="contents">If the above information is correct, who took the decision to make the change and when?
</p>
<p class="contents">Does the Commission realize that, as well as amounting to gross ignorance of historical and cultural reality, such a decision would be bound to entail adverse political consequences, especially since Croatia has never been part of the Balkans, but is a Central European country whose fundamental sympathies have always lain with the West?

Question No 86 by Mair Morgan (H−0002/98)</span> </span></p>
<p class="contents">Subject: Child labour
</p>
<p class="contents">What measures has the Commission taken to ensure that child labour, particularly bonded child labour has not been used in the production of carpets, clothes, footwear and other manufactured goods imported into the European Union from the Indian subcontinent?
</p>
<p class="contents"><span class="italic">
<span class="italic">
Answer</span> </span></p>
<p class="contents">1. 
The latest co‐operation agreements signed with countries of South Asia (currently India, Sri Lanka, Nepal) include a Human Right clause, giving the possibility to the Commission to raise this issue with partners and eventually to take, if necessary, appropriate measures.

</p>
<p class="contents">2. 
In the framework of the revised Community's scheme of generalized tariff preferences (GSP), laid down in Regulations (EC) No 3281/94 and (EC) 1256/96<a href="#def_12_15" name="ref_12_15"><sup>(15)</sup></a>

 the Council has adopted provisions in favour of the elimination of child labour. Pursuant to the aforementioned Regulations the preferential treatment may be temporarily withdrawn from beneficiary countries in the case of bonded labour either of adults or children (Article 9).

</p>
<p class="contents">It has also adopted the principle of a social incentive regime (Article 7) to be put into operation in 1998. Under this new initiative scheme, additional preferences may be granted, on their request, to countries which have adopted and are effectively enforcing the substance of international standards established by the International Labour Organization (ILO). Those relate, on the one hand, to the rights of workers to organize and bargain collectively (ILO Conventions Nos 87 and 98) and, on the other hand, to the minimum age for admission to employment (ILO Convention No 138). The Council is currently discussing the proposal adopted by the Commission in October 1997 which sets out the intensity and the modalities for implementing this special incentive arrangement.
</p>
<p class="contents">3. 
Other measures include activities aimed at the elimination of child labour/bonded labour. In this context the Commission is launching a development aid project in collaboration with the ILO, which will supplement the ILO's efforts in Pakistan within the scope of its International Programme for the Elimination of Child Labour.

Question No 87 by Jaak Vandemeulebroucke (H−0003/98)</span> </span></p>
<p class="contents">Subject: Language use in the Official Journal
</p>
<p class="contents">The Official Journal L328 of 28 November 1997 contains a list of the authorities subject to the agreement on public contracts. On page 10 for Belgium there is a list only in the French language.
</p>
<p class="contents">The Commission is aware of my concern with regard to the use of languages. Can it indicate why this list was included only in French? Should it be assumed that the Dutch and German speakers are not subject to this legislation on tenders?
</p>
<p class="contents"><span class="italic">
<span class="italic">
Answer</span> </span></p>
<p class="contents">The question posed by the Honourable Member appears to seek an answer to the question why Annex 1 to European Parliament and Council Directive 97/52/EC, published in the Official Journal L 328 of 28 November 1997 lists the Belgian authorities in the French language only and to the question whether it should be assumed, in the absence of a list of Belgian authorities in the Dutch and German languages, that the Dutch and German speakers are not subject to this legislation.
</p>
<p class="contents">
<span class="bold">
The reason for publishing the list of Belgian authorities in French only.</span></p>
<p class="contents">European Parliament and Council Directive 97/52/EC has been adopted to adapt existing Community legislation in the field of public procurement<a href="#def_12_16" name="ref_12_16"><sup>(16)</sup></a>

 to the Agreement on Government Procurement, concluded at the end of the Uruguay Round of multilateral trade negotiations, on April 15, 1994. Annex 1 to this Agreement lists the contracting authorities which will procure in accordance with the provisions of the Agreement. The Agreement on Government Procurement has three official languages, English, French and Spanish. Therefore, all States had to provide their contribution to the annexes in, at least, one of these official languages. Belgium provided its contribution for Annex 1 to the Agreement in French. The annexes have been approved as such by the States Parties to the Agreement and are now an integral part of the Agreement on Government Procurement.
</p>
<p class="contents">European Parliament and Council Directive 97/52/EC contains in its Annex 1 the list of contracting authorities as they were approved for the Agreement on Government Procurement.
</p>
<p class="contents">
<span class="bold">
The presumption that, in the absence of a Dutch and German version of Annex 1, Dutch and German speakers are not subject to this legislation.</span></p>
<p class="contents">The Commission kindly reminds the Honourable Member of the fact that a directive is not addressed to individual persons, but to the Member States. The Member States are bound to implement, within the time period provided for by the directive, the directive in their national legislation. The Belgian authorities are therefore entitled to take the necessary steps that their national constitution or legislation requires in order to respect the use of the languages in their country.
</p>
<p class="contents">Moreover, as a general rule, the question whether or not someone, contracting authority or interested company, is subject to the national legislation implementing Community directives, does not depend on the language that person speaks, but on the contents of that legislation.

Question No 88 by María Izquierdo Rojo (H−0010/98)</span> </span></p>
<p class="contents">Subject: Violence against women
</p>
<p class="contents">The European Parliament recently adopted a resolution on the need to establish a European Union wide campaign for zero tolerance of violence against women<a href="#def_12_17" name="ref_12_17"><sup>(17)</sup></a>

.
</p>
<p class="contents">In the light of this resolution and given the need to uphold women's right to life as part of efforts to safeguard human rights and combat this invisible crime effectively: 
</p>
<p class="contents">When and how will the Commission launch European campaigns to combat violence against women? What timetable has it drawn up for such campaigns? Given the social costs of violence against women in terms of spending on social security, health care, legal costs, education, etc., will it seek to make those responsible for violence against women contribute in some way to the funding necessary to implement this policy designed to protect women?
</p>
<p class="contents"><span class="italic">
<span class="italic">
Answer</span> </span></p>
<p class="contents">1. 
The Commission fully shares the Honourable Member's concern on the need to effectively combat violence against women.

</p>
<p class="contents">It is already focusing on this problem, particularly by means of the DAPHNE Initiative which supports several relevant projects, for example that of the European Women's Lobby creating a European Observatory on Violence against Women, and a research project by Crime Concern UK into methods of preventing domestic violence against women.
</p>
<p class="contents">2. 
The Commission takes the view that a European campaign to combat such violence against women can only be effective if it has an assured budget. Although the 1998 budget line for the DAPHNE Initiative contains funding for measures to prepare for the 1999 European Year against Violence against Women, the Parliament has not yet made available funds for the Year itself. Such funds could only be included in the 1999 budget and by the time it is adopted in December 1998 it will be too late to make the necessary commitments and arrangements for 1999. In these circumstances, the Commission is proposing to designate 8 March 1999 (International Women's Day) as a day against violence against women and to mark it as such by holding a suitable event.

</p>
<p class="contents">This event might take the form of a conference or a seminar. The Commission will in any case discuss this matter with the appropriate bodies in the Parliament, not least with the Women's Rights Committee.
</p>
<p class="contents">3. 
The Commission is aware of the costs of violence not merely to the victims themselves but to society as a whole, both in financial and social terms Certain financial costs are recoverable from the perpetrators in criminal or civil proceedings before national courts or tribunals, but compensation and recovery of costs is a matter for complainants to raise according to the rules of the individual Member States.

</p>
<p class="contents">As regards the social and emotional costs, not merely do these fall on the victims and their families but also on the social and support services of the Member States themselves. The recovery of such costs by the Member States can only be a matter for the State concerned.

Question No 89 by David Martin (H−0012/98)</span> </span></p>
<p class="contents">Subject: Non‐compliance of high voltage (HV) switchgear and controlgear
</p>
<p class="contents">It has been brought to my attention that suppliers of high voltage switchgear and controlgear are being allowed to continue supplying apparatus that is non‐compliant with the requirements of the EMC Directive 89/336/EEC<a href="#def_12_18" name="ref_12_18"><sup>(18)</sup></a>

 which was fully implemented on 1 January 1996, and at variance with the latest Guidelines On The Application Of Council Directive 89/336/EEC of May 1989 On The Approximation Of The Laws Of The Member States Relating To Electromagnetic Compatibility. Can the Commission outline what action it will take to make sure Directive 89/336/EEC is complied with?
</p>
<p class="contents"><span class="italic">
<span class="italic">
Answer</span> </span></p>
<p class="contents">To date, the Commission has not received any specific evidence or formal complaints about cases of non‐compliance in the application of the EMC Directive to ‚high voltage switchgear and controlgear’.
</p>
<p class="contents">The devices considered must indeed be deemed to be covered by the EMC Directive, 
<span class="italic">
unless</span> it can be demonstrated that they are not liable to cause electromagnetic disturbance.
</p>
<p class="contents">The Electromagnetic Compatibility (EMC) Directive, applies in fact to all electric and electronic appliances together with equipment and installations containing electric or electronic components, 
<span class="italic">
provided they are liable</span> to cause electromagnetic disturbance, or to be affected by such disturbance.
</p>
<p class="contents">Inclusion or exclusion of specific equipment must be determined not only taking into account their characteristics, but also the way in which they are intended to be operated and their expected electromagnetic environment. The Commission has recently published a Guide, which includes amongst other things, criteria for determining which apparatus is excluded from the application of the Directive.
</p>
<p class="contents">In order to give a more complete answer on the issue, the Commission would need more detailed information. In particular, the type of equipment considered, its EMC characteristics and where, why and by whom it has been placed on the market in spite of not being in compliance with the Directive.
</p>
<p class="contents">The Guide on the application of the EMC Directive does in fact mention among the exclusions from its scope, protection equipment like circuit breakers without electronic parts, or components which are electromagnetically active and which only produce disturbance of very short duration. Manual switches that are not EMC active may also be excluded. However, it is not possible without further details to conclude that the devices in question might fall within those categories.
</p>
<p class="contents">The Commission is fully prepared to enquire and examine the issue further as soon as it will get more precise information.

Question No 90 by Mark Watts (H−0013/98)</span> </span></p>
<p class="contents">Subject: Slaughter of sheep in France for Eid‐El‐Kabir festival
</p>
<p class="contents">In April 1997 the mass ritual slaughter of sheep in France caused enormous public outrage. Last September, responding to Oral Question No 90 H−0613/97<a href="#def_12_19" name="ref_12_19"><sup>(19)</sup></a>

, the Commissioner informed me that the Commission cannot accept that those infringements of Community legislation should be permitted to continue, and that it seemed reasonable to ask the French authorities to confirm that in future the festival will be organized according to the Community legislation concerned. He promised: 'If the French authorities fail to provide adequate guarantees concerning future compliance with Community law in this respect, the Commission will consider the opening of the infringement procedure provided for under Article 169 of the EC Treaty.' What guarantees has the Commission now obtained, and can it reassure me that this abhorrent barbarism will not be allowed to take place this year?
</p>
<p class="contents"><span class="italic">
<span class="italic">
Answer</span> </span></p>
<p class="contents">The Commission has intervened further with the French authorities stressing that although directive 93/119/EC permits religious slaughter of animals, neither the directive nor the relevant Community public and animal health rules allow such slaughter to be carried out in the open air or other places outside slaughterhouses.
</p>
<p class="contents">France has, in consequence, been requested to confirm that it will take the necessary action to ensure that the relevant provisions of Community law will in future be respected.
</p>
<p class="contents">The Commission will monitor carefully any reports it receives of breaches of the relevant rules during this year's celebrations of the festival in question.
</p>
<p class="contents">The Commission is conscious of the fact that this is a sensitive issue involving the religious and cultural traditions of certain ethnic minorities. However, given the information it has obtained about the arrangements made in other Member States also having minority populations sharing the same religious faith, it appears to the Commission that it is quite possible for the celebration of ‚Eid‐El‐Kabir’ to take place in a manner which respects the relevant animal welfare rules.
</p>
<p class="contents">Depending on the reports it receives concerning this year's celebration, the Commission will consider the question of opening the Article 169 of the EC Treaty procedure in the near future.

Question No 91 by José Valverde López (H−0016/98)</span> </span></p>
<p class="contents">Subject: 'Vegetable oil' as a generic label
</p>
<p class="contents">The use of the term 'vegetable oil' as a generic food label runs seriously counter to consumers' information rights and economic interests and to the right to health. Specific forms of labelling must be introduced to make it clear what type of 'vegetable oil or fat' is involved in each individual case; to fail to do so is to encourage fraud and disinformation.
</p>
<p class="contents">What initiatives is the Commission preparing to put an end to the extremely negative effect of this aspect of EC legislation on consumers' rights?
</p>
<p class="contents"><span class="italic">
<span class="italic">
Answer</span> </span></p>
<p class="contents">As the Commission explained in its answer to the Member's written question No 1609/97, the use of the term ‚vegetable oil’ in the list of ingredients of a food containing this type of ingredient complies with the Community legislation in force. In fact, paragraph 5(b) of Article 6 of Directive 79/112/EEC relating to the labelling of foodstuffs, states that ingredients in one of the categories listed in Annex I to the directive may be described in lists of ingredients using the name of the category only. Annex I states that refined oils other than olive oil may be described as ‚oils’ together with either the adjective ‚vegetable’ or an indication of specific vegetable origin. The same rule is applicable to refined fats. A similar provision is found in the ‚labelling’ standard of the codex alimentarius, at international level. It is of course understood that when oils or fats are sold as such, they must be labelled to indicate their specific origin.
</p>
<p class="contents">The Commission has not been advised to date of any economic difficulties arising from the implementation of this rule, which has been established for twenty years. The terms ‚vegetable oils’ or ‚vegetable fats’ provide objective information and are therefore unlikely to mislead consumers with regard to the characteristics of a product. Economic operators can always enhance the information on the ingredients used by specifying the type of vegetable oil.
</p>
<p class="contents">As far as health problems are concerned, the Commission is at present examining the need to amend Directive 79/112/EEC in order to improve the information provided for people suffering from food allergies or intolerance. The preparation of a list of foods or ingredients scientifically recognized to cause allergies, which should be included without fail in lists of ingredients if contained in a food (soya, peanut, walnut, etc.), is envisaged.
</p>
<p class="contents">According to the information available to the Commission, it would seem, however, that only unrefined oils produced from such foods are likely to cause allergic reactions.

Question No 92 by Gunilla Carlsson (H−0025/98)</span> </span></p>
<p class="contents">Subject: Guidelines for Commission officials
</p>
<p class="contents">On 5 November 1997, the European Ombudsman gave his decision on the complaint regarding Commissioner Liikanen's letter to Director‐General Magnus Lemmel. In that decision, the Ombudsman draws attention to the need for the Commission to draw up guidelines concerning the possibilities officials have for establishing a reasonable balance between their scope for expressing opinions during the exercise of their duties and their fundamental right of free speech as provided for by the European Convention on Human Rights.<br/>In view of this, will the Commission state whether it intends to draw up such guidelines and, if it does, when it will present them?
</p>
<p class="contents"><span class="italic">
<span class="italic">
Answer</span> </span></p>
<p class="contents">During 1997, the Commission undertook some reforms to reinforce and modernize its administrative and financial management. Within that context, the Commission is at present working on the preparation of a Code of Conduct for European Commission officials in their relationship with the public. A non‐definitive version of the draft Code of Conduct has in fact been forwarded to the European Ombudsman within the framework of an informal consultation.
</p>
<p class="contents">Further to the recommendations addressed to the Commission by the Ombudsman that it should publish guidelines on the freedom of speech of officials, which should strike a balance between their freedom of speech and the duties and responsibilities resulting from their Staff Regulations, the Commission has become aware of the need to clarify this concept. The current exercise will provide an excellent opportunity to respond to the Ombudsman's expectations.

Question No 93 by Jaime Valdivielso de Cué (H−0027/98)</span> </span></p>
<p class="contents">Subject: New accounting rules
</p>
<p class="contents">In view of the announcement that the Commission is considering introducing new accounting rules, can it state if the new rules will only concern enterprises receiving state aid or if they will also cover private undertakings whose activities are protected by or act a under a monopoly or oligopoly?
</p>
<p class="contents">Will the new rules have the effect of making the legislation applying to public enterprises far more demanding than that applying to the private sector, or will a balance be maintained in respect of the criteria required?
</p>
<p class="contents"><span class="italic">
<span class="italic">
Answer</span> </span></p>
<p class="contents">The Commission is working on an amendment to Directive 80/723/EEC on the transparency of financial relations between Member States and public undertakings. The amendment will establish cost accounting, that is, the separation of the accounts, of undertakings which, on the one hand, have special or exclusive rights or which receive financial support for the provision of ‚services in the general economic interest’ and which also carry out normal competitive activities. The new system will be applicable to private and public undertakings without distinction. The directive does not relate to the harmonization of accounting rules.
</p>
<p class="contents">An instrument of this nature is needed as a result of the growing number of complaints relating to cross‐subsidization within undertakings of this type. The information provided by cost accounting will make it possible to guarantee fair competition and may also be used to justify the existence of special rights and compensatory payments, and consequently, to ensure compliance with public service requirements, which is in the Member States' interests.
</p>
<p class="contents">The Commission is in fact preparing an amendment to the fourth Company Law Directive (Directive 78/660/EEC). The amendment will relate mainly to the valuation principles contained in the directive. It will not affect the scope of the directive itself, which is exclusively based on the legal forms of undertakings. The directive is applicable in the same way to all companies organized as corporate enterprises.
</p>
<p class="contents">The changes it introduces will apply similarly to any undertaking covered by the directive, irrespective of whether the company's capital must be owned by private or public shareholders, whether the undertaking receives government subsidies or whether its market share is significant or marginal.
</p>
<p class="contents">The Commission does not intend, at this stage of the preparation of the amendments in question, to introduce specific rules relating to public undertakings. The consultations it has carried out to date do not reveal any need to introduce such distinctions. Having said that, it is obvious that the Commission will continue to endeavour to ensure that the directives are correctly implemented in all Member States and thus to improve the transparency and comparability of company accounts.

Question No 94 by Per Gahrton (H−0034/98)</span></span></p>
<p class="contents">Subject: Sweden's derogations on feeding stuff additives
</p>
<p class="contents">A number of derogations granted to Sweden concerning feeding stuff additives expired at the end of 1997. Sweden has been forced to lift some of its bans, e.g. on synthetic carotenoids and formic acid. Why does the Commission not consider such bans appropriate? Several other bans remain only because the Commission's committee has not been able to consider them yet. Does the Commission also intend to force Sweden to lift its bans on aflatoxins, ratoxins, copper, lead, PCB and phosphorus? The ban on meat‐and‐bone meal will be tightened up on 1 April. Does the Commission intend to propose banning MBM throughout the EU? Or will Sweden be forced to fall into line with the EU on this matter, too? Can the Commission name any instance in which it has brought or intends to bring its rules into line with Swedish environmental or health rules?
</p>
<p class="contents"><span class="italic">
<span class="italic">
Answer</span> </span></p>
<p class="contents">On joining the European Community, Sweden did in fact obtain several derogations relating to the implementation of Community legislation on animal nutrition, some of which expired on 31 December 1997.
</p>
<p class="contents">Between August and December 1997, Sweden very belatedly supplied the detailed scientific evidence to justify its requests for the amendment of Community legislation. If Sweden has had induced to drop some of its requests, particularly with regard to carotinoids and xanthophylls, it is because it does not have the required scientific basis to justify such bans.
</p>
<p class="contents">The Commission intends to re‐evaluate specific provisions of Community legislation in the light of the Swedish information as soon as possible. On 26 and 27 January, the Standing Committee on Feeding Stuffs examined some possible ways of adapting the present legislation, for example, by making it compulsory to show the phosphorus content of compound Feeding stuffs for fish, which until now was optional. Breeders would thus have better information on the phosphorus content of Feeding stuffs and could help to limit environmental emissions.
</p>
<p class="contents">The Member will however understand that the Commission cannot approve requests for amendments to Community legislation unless they are based on adequate scientific data.
</p>
<p class="contents">With regard to meat meals, the Commission has not asked Sweden to withdraw its national measures. In fact, the Commission is awaiting the results of the wider consultation it has initiated with regard to a possible general ban on meat meals, before suggesting guidelines.

<p class="contents">On 17 December 1997, a Ukrainian passenger aircraft, a Yakolev, crashed in western Macedonia, killing all the passengers and the crew. The investigation into the accident was undertaken by the Special Committee of the Greek Civil Aviation Service. On the basis of Council Directive 94/56/EC<a href="#def_12_20" name="ref_12_20"><sup>(20)</sup></a>

, Member States are obliged to set up a Permanent Civil Aviation Monitoring Body which should be operationally independent of the national airport authorities with the task of investigating air accidents and formulating recommendations regarding safety. The Member States are required to comply with the Directive by 21 November 1996. Will the Commission say whether a Permanent Body has been set up in Greece, and if not why the Commission services have failed to monitor implementation of Directive 94/56/EC and what initiatives they will take to ensure that it is implemented forthwith?
</p>
<p class="contents"><span class="italic">
<span class="italic">
Answer</span> </span></p>
<p class="contents">The existing Accident Investigation Section in Greece is part of the Hellenic Civil Aviation Authority and does not, therefore, comply with the provision of Directive 94/56 which requires the investigation to be carried out by a permanent body, independent from the regulatory authority.
</p>
<p class="contents">In May 1997, the Commission wrote to the Greek Government, in accordance with the procedure laid down in Article 169 of the EC Treaty, requesting that it submit its observations on the assumed infringements of the provisions of the Treaty.

Question No 96 by Alfred Lomas (H−0037/98)</span> </span></p>
<p class="contents">Subject: EU regulations applying to medical treatment in EU countries
</p>
<p class="contents">Will the Commission confirm the legislation relating to medical treatment for EU nationals. If a French national woman, married to a British national man and dependent on her husband's national insurance contributions, seeks medical treatment in France, does she need to obtain Form E112?
</p>
<p class="contents"><span class="italic">
<span class="italic">
Answer</span> </span></p>
<p class="contents">Regulation 1408/71 on the coordination of social security schemes offers significant protection to Community workers and members of their families, especially in cases when they reside outside the Member State where they are insured, in cases of temporary stay out of this Member State and when – as in the case under consideration – they move to another Member State for treatment.
</p>
<p class="contents">In the present case, although the person concerned is a French national, she is a member of the family of a person insured in the UK, and it is therefore the UK sickness insurance institution which is competent.
</p>
<p class="contents">Article 22(1)(c) of Regulation 1408/71 provides that persons insured in one Member State have a right to move to another Member State to undergo treatment only if they have received prior authorization from their sickness insurance institution. The E112 form testifies that the person is entitled to receive the said benefits and states the period for which the authorization is given. The institution to which the form is addressed has, upon presentation of the form, the duty to provide the health care concerned.
</p>
<p class="contents">Normally it is up to the sickness insurance institution to decide whether or not it will give its approval. However, where the treatment in question is among the benefits provided for by the legislation of the Member State where the person is insured, but not available within the time normally necessary with regard to the person's state of health, the required permission may not be refused.
</p>
<p class="contents">Therefore, in the case described by the Honourable Member, the person should obtain the E112 form before going to France to undergo medical treatment. She will then be reimbursed by the UK sickness insurance institution.
</p>
<p class="contents">However, the Commission would also like to draw the attention of the Honourable Member to the fact that, in the

<p class="contents">In 1997, the Commission supported a far‐reaching research project carried out by Bristol University (UK). The purpose of this research was to draw a precise picture of the use of sign languages in the Community and to determine the comparative status of sign language in the different Member States.
</p>
<p class="contents">The study highlighted the fact that sign languages can achieve official status in different ways and that there are major variations between Member States in terms of their experience and provision of sign language.
</p>
<p class="contents">Sign languages in the Member States of Northern Europe appear to receive greater political and social recognition than in Southern Europe, resulting in better awareness of deafness and better provision of services to hearing‐impaired people.
</p>
<p class="contents">A copy of the full report has been sent to the Honourable Member.
</p>
<p class="contents">In line with its overall disability strategy, which recognizes that primary responsibility for action in this field rests with the Member States, the Commission endeavours to bring about the added value to be gained from cooperating at European level in terms of exchanging experience and transferring know‐how.
</p>
<p class="contents">The Commission therefore supports a broad range of activities advancing the interests of deaf people, in particular through its support of the European Union of the Deaf.
</p>
<p class="contents">However, the Commission has no plans at the moment to present specific proposals on the issue to the Council.

Question No 98 by Esko Seppänen (H−0045/98)</span> </span></p>
<p class="contents">Subject: Double taxation and freedom of movement
</p>
<p class="contents">Finnish nationals working in Sweden have paid their taxes to Sweden and receive their pensions from the Swedish state. They also pay tax on their pensions to Sweden. If a Finn who has worked in Sweden moves to Finland, he also pays tax on his pension in Finland. The tax paid in Sweden may be deducted from the tax payable in Finland, but the right of deduction does not apply to charges similar to taxes (veronluonteiset maksut). The persons concerned are thus partly subject to double taxation. Double taxation restricts the freedom of movement between these two Member States.
</p>
<p class="contents">What does the Commission propose to do to guarantee freedom of movement?
</p>
<p class="contents"><span class="italic">
<span class="italic">
Answer</span> </span></p>
<p class="contents">The Commission has been informed of tax problems which Finnish residents, who have worked in Sweden, face with respect to Swedish pensions. The Commission has been made aware that legislative changes have recently been made to the applicable rules, and the Finnish authorities have been asked for information.
</p>
<p class="contents">Whilst waiting for that information, the following general observations can be made: 
</p>
<p class="contents">In the absence of any fiscal harmonization in the field of personal income taxation, the national rules apply; these must, however, respect the Treaty, in particular the four freedoms and the non‐discrimination principle.<br/>Double taxation of income is avoided by the double taxation conventions which provide for either imputation (of foreign paid tax from national tax due) or exemption from tax in one of the Member States concerned. In the latter case, the exempted income may, however, be taken into account in order to determine the applicable tax rate for the overall income (so‐called progressivity clause), which can result in a higher tax, in line with the principle of contributive capacity.
</p>
<p class="contents">As regards taxes not covered by a double taxation convention, the Commission would like to ask the Honourable Member to indicate in more detail which kind of taxes he means.
</p>
<p class="contents">Conflicts as to the competence of which Member State is entitled to levy social contributions are governed by Community law. A precise indication of levies causing problems would, however, be necessary to allow the Commission to look into the cases which the Honourable Member has in mind.

Question No 99 by Alan Donnelly (H−0047/98)</span> </span></p>
<p class="contents">Subject: Conference on maritime education and training at Expo 98
</p>
<p class="contents">The theme of EXPO 98 is 'The Ocean – A Heritage of the Future' and will provide a major opportunity for European maritime activities to emphasize their ongoing commitment to this sector and highlight the application of high technology and quality standards. This statement must, of course, be supported by the European Commission and the European Parliament, capitalizing on the forward looking policy initiatives taken in recent years.
</p>
<p class="contents">An important element in this initiative is to ensure that the necessary skills and experience are available in the future by recruiting, educating and training the people involved in these activities. As part of its input to EXPO 98, is the European Commission going to organize a Conference on Maritime Education and Training in Lisbon?
</p>
<p class="contents"><span class="italic">
<span class="italic">
Answer</span> </span></p>
<p class="contents">The Community pavilion at EXPO '98 will include a Commission presentation of Community policies and initiatives linked to the theme of the exhibition, ’The Ocean – A Heritage of the Future’. The European Action Plan for the Information Society (including the MARIS project) and maritime Research and Technological Development will, for example, figure prominently.
</p>
<p class="contents">The Commission will also organize a Conference on Europe and Quality Shipping, the purpose of which is to discuss with all shipping industries and services what commitments they are prepared to take without delay to encourage a more safety‐minded culture in shipping. Maritime Education and Training systems are very important to ensure high levels of maritime safety and environmental protection, as well as improvements in the living and working conditions of seafarers, and these subjects will naturally continue to have particular attention.
</p>
<p class="contents">In December 1996, the Commission and the Irish Presidency organized the Dublin Conference on seafarers training and employment and since then the Commission has proposed amendments to Council Directive 94/58/EC on the minimum level of training of seafarers in order to comply with the new requirements of the 1995 Convention on Seafarer Training, Certification and Watchkeeping (STCW). Furthermore, the Commission is preparing a report on the Maritime Education and Training systems in the Member States and will publish that in due course.
</p>
<p class="contents">These actions will help to improve the qualifications of seafarers and will certainly have an impact on the sector's employment.
</p>
<p class="contents">In addition, the Commission is giving consideration to contributing to a conference in September on the Community's actions on maritime vocational training which would consider how vocational training should be developed to meet the needs of the maritime sector in the future, taking into account adaptation to new technologies.
</p>
<p class="contents">The Commission is currently working with the relevant European associations in order to make provisional arrangements for such a conference.

Question No 100 by Brian Crowley (H−0050/98)</span> </span></p>
<p class="contents">Subject: Norwegian herring
</p>
<p class="contents">Herring fishermen in Ireland are being offered particularly low prices for the fish which they land this season partly at least because of the 23 000 tonne allowance for herring imports from Norway and also because of the preferential tariffs which the Norwegians enjoy in the Polish market by comparison with Irish fishermen.
</p>
<p class="contents">Has the Commission undertaken an assessment of the economic impact of these factors affecting the market for herring, particularly in so far as they affect the income of fishermen along the south west coast of Ireland? Will the Commission now take steps to reduce the quantity of Norwegian herring given access to the European Union market and also seek access for European Union herring to the Polish market on the same terms as those available to Norway?
</p>
<p class="contents"><span class="italic">
<span class="italic">
Answer</span> </span></p>
<p class="contents">More than 70 % of chilled and frozen herring imported in the Community from third countries in 1995 was imported duty free. In addition to this, in 1996 and 1997, an autonomous tariff quota of 40 000 tonnes and of 23 000 tonnes, respectively, were opened as a consequence of the herring quota shortage in the North Sea.
</p>
<p class="contents">Most of the EC herring imports originate in Norway and this country currently benefits from the various ‚
<span class="italic">
erga omnes</span>’ tariff concessions given by the Community, including the 23, 000 tonnes mentioned in the Honourable Member's question, although not all this volume of fish has necessarily been imported from Norway.
</p>
<p class="contents">The present tariff situation in the Community regarding herring is as follows: 
</p>
<p class="contents">Between 1 January and 14 February the MFN rate of duty of 15 % is applicable.
</p>
<p class="contents">Between 15 February and 15 June imports are duty free.
</p>
<p class="contents">Between 16 June and 31 December the MFN rate of duty is reintroduced, but: <br/>a GATT quota of 34, 000 tonnes at 0 % rate of duty is opened; <br/>a tariff quota of 800 tonnes in favour of Norway is opened; <br/>imports of herring originating in the Faeroe Islands are duty free; <br/>in 1996 and 1997 the already mentioned autonomous tariff quotas for herring have been opened.
</p>
<p class="contents">According to the statistical series of prices for landings of herring in Killybegs and Rossaveal available to the Commission (01.01.96/01.08.97), no correlation can be established between the level of prices and the level of duties.
</p>
<p class="contents">According to the Commission statistical data base, no imports of fresh, chilled or frozen herring have been made in Ireland in 1996 and 1997, whether from Norway or from any other origin.
</p>
<p class="contents">Given the circumstances, the Commission cannot share the view that low prices in Ireland are due to the 23, 000 tonnes autonomous tariff quota opened in 1997. On the other hand, it may be that prices in Ireland are influenced more by export possibilities than by imports.
</p>
<p class="contents">It is true that the Norwegians enjoy preferential tariffs in the Polish market, while the Community exporters have to pay the full rate of duty. But it is also true that Polish herring does not benefit from any preference in the EC market, apart from those that are given on an ‚
<span class="italic">
erga omnes</span>’ basis. As regards Norwegian herring imported in the Community, it is not possible for the Community to go back on international agreements already concluded either bilaterally, such as that with Norway, or multilaterally, such as the GATT tariff quota.
</p>
<p class="contents">Furthermore, the Commission, together with the Member States of the Community, has maintained regular contacts with the Polish authorities, in view of the negotiation of a fisheries agreement and reciprocal tariff concessions. Unfortunately, up to now, these contacts have not yielded any results.
</p>
<p class="contents">The Commission does not foresee any tariff reduction for fishery products originating in Poland, as it does not foresee any tariff concession from Poland in the short term. In the medium term, this possibility could be envisaged, depending on the evolution of the negotiations for a fisheries agreement.
</p>
<p class="contents">In view of the current market situation and the increase in the herring quotas available to the Community in 1998, the Commission does not intend to propose that the Community open an autonomous tariff quota for herring this year.

</p>
<p class="contents">Following Parliament's resolution of 14 March 1996, can the Commission report on its implementation of this resolution and its assessment of the current situation as concerns finding a solution to the refugee problem?
</p>
<p class="contents"><span class="italic">
<span class="italic">
Answer</span> </span></p>
<p class="contents">The recommendations contained in the EP resolution of 14 March 1996 are followed up and implemented as much as possible, provided that they are in the area of the Commission's competence. In this respect, the Commission
</p>
<p class="contents"><span class="italic">(i) maintains a continuous dialogue with the governments of Bhutan and Nepal to convince them to reach an agreement; </span></p>
<p class="contents"><span class="italic">(ii) since 1992 provides, as the most important donor, assistance to the refugees in eastern Nepal: between 1992 and 1997 about ECU 13.5 million have been allocated for ‚care and maintenance’, plus relevant assistance occasionally provided for humanitarian support and food aid.</span></p>
<p class="contents"><span class="italic">(iii) has made it clear to both governments that, conditional to a political solution, it is prepared to help them in the repatriation and resettlement process of the refugees, both those who will be selected for returning to Bhutan and those who will possibly remain in Nepal.</span></p>
<p class="contents">The Commission is, however, conscious that there is not an easy solution to that problem, especially when, mindful of the Sikkim political disappearance, the evidence is accepted that Bhutan is fighting a battle to preserve its unique identity. This was the important message delivered to the EP Delegation for South Asia and SAARC (South Asian Association for Regional Cooperation), when they visited Bhutan and Nepal in November 1997.
</p>
<p class="contents">The Commission's assessment of the current situation is that a durable solution can come only from the two main parties' negotiations, which are hopefully ongoing. Unfortunately, the political instability and uncertainty which prevails in Nepal does not facilitate a quick solution of the problem.
</p>
<p class="contents">A mediating role has been refused by the Indian Government as well as by the EU, several Member States having expressed their reluctance to such role and considered the UNHCR in a better position for such purpose.

Question No 102 by Marianne Eriksson (H−0055/98)</span> </span></p>
<p class="contents">Subject: Use of acrylamide in the Member States
</p>
<p class="contents">In its resolution B4‐0833/97 of 23 October 1997, Parliament calls on the Commission to investigate the use of acrylamide, which is contained in the sealing compound, Rhoca‐GII, among other products, in the Member States. Parliament also urges the Commission to propose a total ban on the use of acrylamide where it constitutes a risk to human health or the environment or where alternatives exist.
</p>
<p class="contents">What is the Commission's position on these proposals?
</p>
<p class="contents">Does the Commission consider that there should be an investigation into whether the French chemicals company, Rhone‐Poulenc, has broken EU environment legislation in connection with the toxic waste scandal surrounding the building of the tunnel through Hallandsåsen in Sweden?
</p>
<p class="contents"><span class="italic">
<span class="italic">
Answer</span> </span></p>
<p class="contents">The Commission is following the development of the incident in Sweden where dangerous substances leached into the environment during construction of a railway tunnel. One of these substances was acrylamide, another substance mentioned is N‐methylol‐acrylamide. The Commission is, however, not aware of all the details since the incident is still the subject of investigation by the Swedish authorities.
</p>
<p class="contents">According to Commission policy, restrictions on the marketing and use of dangerous substances should be based on risk assessments and analyses of costs and benefits. Acrylamide, one of the components of Rhoca‐Gil, has been given priority for risk assessment under the regulation on existing substances. As part of the risk assessment information on the use of acrylamide is gathered. This evaluation will also focus on the use of the substance as a grouting agent in tunnels, investigating local environment and workers protection issues. If the risk assessment concludes that the risk posed by acrylamide needs to be reduced a risk reduction strategy will be proposed.
</p>
<p class="contents">Member States are responsible for ensuring that the Community legislation for the control of chemicals are followed by manufacturers, distributors and importers placing chemicals on the Community market.
</p>
<p class="contents">The various directives applying to chemicals, specifically to acrylamide, have been transposed to national law. Sweden is currently investigating the incident in Hallandsasen and will clarify whether the applicable legislation has been respected.
</p>
<p class="contents">If it is the case that existing legislation is not sufficient to protect health and the environment, the Swedish authorities could bring this to the attention of the Commission.

Question No 103 by Ulla Sandbæk (H−0057/98)</span> </span></p>
<p class="contents">Subject: EU sponsored structural adjustment programmes
</p>
<p class="contents">Between 1995 and 1999, ECU 1400 m is being made available by the EU under the Lomé Convention to ACP countries implementing structural adjustment programmes. Studies show that the benefit to women is questionable. For instance, in a 1995 report: 'Gender and Structural Adjustment in Tanzanian Agriculture', Ingrid Palmer showed how reform policies at the macrolevel make women in farm households work harder for less access to and control over resources. Following such studies, the EU Council of Development Ministers agreed a resolution on Integration Gender Issues in development Cooperation in December 1995.
</p>
<p class="contents">What indicators from micro‐ and meso‐level are currently being used by the Commission in relation to structural adjustment policies, and how is the interdependence between women's and men's roles both in production and in reproduction and the maintenance of human resources being measures and integrated into structural adjustment policy formulation?
</p>
<p class="contents"><span class="italic">
<span class="italic">
Answer</span> </span></p>
<p class="contents">The EC Structural Adjustment Support Programmes are designed to reflect the commitment in Article 243 of the revised Lomé IV Convention ‚to ensure that adjustment is economically viable and socially and politically bearable. For example, in most countries budgetary support under the EC Structural Adjustment Facility is targeted to social sector related expenditures. Indicators typically used are the health and education sector shares in a government's budget. At the same time, in some countries such as Tanzania, complementary support for the recipient's education and/or health sector programmes is provided. In Tanzania the Commission is particularly aware of the need to improve female education indicators, such as female enrolment and study completion percentages.
</p>
<p class="contents">Evidently there is a need to further refine the design of Adjustment Policies and support for them to take more specific account of gender and environmental dimensions, among others. Studies in this area are ongoing, including the study in Tanzania, which is being complemented by additional field research. However, the analysis of constraints to women's participation in economic development and the translation of the results of such analysis into operational policies and indicators is a complex process, and so far appropriate indicators at micro‐ and meso‐level have not yet been agreed.
</p>
<p class="contents">As part of the above process leading to the better incorporation of the gender dimension in adjustment policies and support, and also in project design generally, a programme is under way in 13 ACP countries including Tanzania, to improve gender awareness among government policy‐makers, and project planning personnel, as well as EC Delegation staff. The development of gender dimension project indicators are part of the programme.

Question No 104 by Anne McIntosh (H−0060/98)</span> </span></p>
<p class="contents">Subject: The Second EC Driving Licence Directive
</p>
<p class="contents">Will the Commission reconsider the Driving Licence Directive and, in particular, the impact that its provisions will have on diabetic drivers and their right to drive 3.5‐7.5 tonne vehicles?
</p>
<p class="contents">Does the Commission agree that the standards imposed under this Directive discriminate against diabetics, causing a great deal of personal distress?
</p>
<p class="contents"><span class="italic">
<span class="italic">
Answer</span> </span></p>
<p class="contents">In 1991 the Transport Ministers' Council adopted Directive 91/439/EEC on driving licences with the aim of facilitating the free movement of persons and of enhancing road safety. This Directive contained a harmonization of the conditions for issuing and renewing driving licences, including the ‚Minimum standards of physical and mental fitness for driving a power‐driven vehicle’.
</p>
<p class="contents">These minimum standards make the provision that a driving licence may only be issued or renewed for drivers of lorries and buses (including small lorries and minibuses) who suffer from diabetes mellitus in very exceptional cases, where duly justified by authorized medical opinion and subject to regular medical check‐ups.
</p>
<p class="contents">The relevant provision was based directly on advice from medical experts from across the Community.
</p>
<p class="contents">Recognizing the impact that these provisions could have for certain licence holders, the Commission included a clause in its original proposal which would have permitted the retention of existing rights in many cases. That clause was rejected by the Transport Ministers' Council.
</p>
<p class="contents">Further consideration was given to the subject at a meeting of the Committee of Governmental Driving Licence experts in April 1996 where the national experts on diabetes mellitus again held that there were no grounds for changing the provisions in the Directive.
</p>
<p class="contents">It is clear that both medical experts and Member State governments believe that, on road safety grounds, the provision concerning diabetes should not be amended. In view of that, and although the Commission recognizes that the application of these provisions can cause personal distress, there are no current plans to reconsider the existing law.
</p>
<p class="contents">However, the Commission will keep the situation under review in the light of scientific progress and advice of medical experts.

Question No 105 by Richard Howitt (H−0065/98)</span> </span></p>
<p class="contents">Subject: Private sector – Peru
</p>
<p class="contents">The RCP (Red Cientifica Peruana) is a Peruvian non‐profit organization which supplies access to Internet and promotes the exchange of information. In order to operate, RCP collaborates with Telefonica del Peru S.A. as this company has been given a monopoly in the provision of telephone services in the country by the Peruvian government. However, from the time that Telefonica de España took control of the Peruvian telephone company and Entelperu, RCP feels it started a series of activities which have been undermining its functioning. In February 1996, RCP presented its case against Telefonica before OSIPTEL and the latter, through resolution o55‐cco/97, 20 months later, recognized the RCP demands.
</p>
<p class="contents">The Commission, in an earlier reply to a parliamentary question (E−3377/97), stated that it 'will support and encourage European firms or sectors to adopt codes of conduct on a voluntary basis but in all such cases the Commission will be asking that a monitoring system be an integral part of the package'. Could the Commission investigate this case and intervene on the basis of the fact that Telefonica is a European company affecting local non‐profit initiatives?
</p>
<p class="contents"><span class="italic">
<span class="italic">
Answer</span> </span></p>
<p class="contents">The dispute between the Red Cientifica Peruana (RCP) and Telefonica del Peru (TDP) was caused by delayed availability of telecommunications circuits for Internet access.
</p>
<p class="contents">In fact, RCP's activity is that of an Internet service provider not only to the scientific community but also to private users and companies. The company had furthermore registered ‚Internet’ as a trademark and was condemned for this reason by INDECOPI (National Institute for the Defence of Competition and Intellectual Property) in Peru.
</p>
<p class="contents">The dispute was referred to OSIPTEL (Supervisory Agency for Private Investment in Telecommunications) which, in the first instance ruled against TDP in the case to which the Member refers. A final decision is now awaited, further to Telefonica del Peru's appeal. It is therefore premature to consider that TDP has been adjudged.
</p>
<p class="contents">There is no reason to envisage action on the basis of the GATS trade rules, which Peru has ratified. This is in fact a dispute within Peru's internal market between a service provider and a telecommunications company, which falls under the authority of the Peruvian organization OSIPTEL, which has furthermore adopted temporary protective measures in favour of RCP before pronouncing judgement on the merits of the case.
</p>
<p class="contents">There is no specific code of conduct in the field of telecommunications; with the European Commission's support, a code of conduct on direct foreign investment is being prepared by the OECD, which the European Commission will help to implement after it is adopted.
</p>
<p class="contents">The Commission is prepared to carry out a fuller investigation of this case, and if justified, appropriate contact could be made with Telefonica Internacional, the majority shareholder of Telefonica del Peru. But the publicity given to this ‚controversy’ on the Internet will, in itself, bring a considerable amount of pressure to bear on the companies involved to adopt attitudes in line with ethical rules.

</p>
<p class="contents">In 1966, the Swedish government set up a committee of inquiry with the task of taking legal action against the dumping of oil from ships at sea.

Question No 107 by Astrid Thors (H−0072/98)</span> </span></p>
<p class="contents">Subject: Waste oil reception facilities at Baltic and Russian ports
</p>
<p class="contents">According to Swedish newspaper reports, 12 000 long‐tailed ducks had to be shot on Gotland last year as they were badly oiled. The year before, 27 000 long‐tailed ducks were shot for the same reason. This enormous suffering inflicted on animals is due to the fact that ports in Russia, the Baltic Republics and Poland are not interested in building reception facilities for waste oil at their ports. Another problem, common to all countries around the Baltic, is that the cleaning of oil from ships' tanks is not included in port charges, and unprincipled skippers discharge waste oil straight into the Baltic to avoid having to pay for cleaning.
</p>
<p class="contents">Is it true that the applicant countries around the Baltic and Russia are unwilling to build reception facilities for oil, and what is the Commission planning to do convince them of the need for such facilities?
</p>
<p class="contents">What progress has been made with the plans to include the cleaning of oil from ships' tanks in port charges at national level and within Helcom?
</p>
<p class="contents"><span class="italic">
<span class="italic">
Joint Answer</span> </span></p>
<p class="contents">The Marpol 73/78 Convention, to which all Member States, the Baltic States, Poland and the Russian Federation are contracting parties, prohibits the discharge of oil or oily mixtures in the Baltic. In addition, Marpol contracting parties must provide adequate facilities for the reception of the residues.
</p>
<p class="contents">Community legislation on port State control already requires Member States to secure compliance with the Marpol Convention. Since the Commission does not believe that to be sufficient to prohibit illegal discharges into the sea, the Commission has announced its intention to adopt a proposal on port reception facilities in its 1998 legislative programme. The purpose of that measure would be to make it mandatory for ports in the Community to have the necessary facilities for waste disposal, including oily waste, and it would also be mandatory for ships to discharge all their waste ashore before leaving these ports. The legislative proposal will also have the intention of ensuring the harmonization of the charging of costs for the disposal of ship‐generated waste.
</p>
<p class="contents">With regard to the Baltic Sea, the Helsinki Commission (HELCOM) has tabled proposals for port reception facilities for shipgenerated waste, which largely follow the Commission's views. In order to allow the Community to take up its responsibilities as a contracting party to HELCOM, where the Commission provides support to all the activities related to the prevention and reduction of marine pollution, whether through accidental or illegal operational oil spills, the Commission will ask the Council for a negotiating mandate when discussing these measures at Ministerial level.

<p class="contents">The Commission ensures impartiality with regard to the procurement of goods and services for its internal operations, by implementing the directives on public contracts. Telephone systems are not an exception to the rule.
</p>
<p class="contents">The contract with the present supplier has two expiry dates: the section relating to the maintenance and operation of installations already in operation will expire at the end of 2001, and the section relating to the equipment of new buildings will expire at the end of 1998.

<p class="contents">Independent consultancy companies and inter‐departmental cooperation will ensure that these procedures produce the best possible quality‐to‐price ratio.
</p>
<p class="contents">At the moment, technology is developing towards multimedia networks, but the Commission will not be able to take advantage of this progress when replacing its equipment until the products have stabilized.

<p class="contents">The Commission is due to adopt its main legislative proposals on the implementation of Agenda 2000 on 18 March 1998 for presentation to the European Parliament and Council. Parliament will therefore be associated on the procedures to approve the new legislation in accordance with the relevant provisions of the Treaty.

Question No 110 by Ulf Holm (H−0090/98)</span></span></p>
<p class="contents">Subject: Food additives
</p>
<p class="contents">When the new EU rules on additives came into effect at the beginning of 1996 the Swedish Government decided not to transpose them in their entirety into Swedish law but retained its earlier ban on azo dyes in foodstuffs, which can produce allergic reactions. Sweden has asked the Commission to be allowed to retain its ban and this request is now being considered. Sweden's ban on azo dyes is now to be examined by the Court of Justice, as a Swedish shop keeper has invoked EC rules on additives after his conviction for selling imported confectionary containing azo dyes.
</p>
<p class="contents">Will the Commission decide on the Swedish request before the Court of Justice gives its ruling?
</p>
<p class="contents"><span class="italic">
<span class="italic">
Answer</span> </span></p>
<p class="contents">As the Member says, the Swedish government has notified the Commission of its decision to retain its national legislation on the use of azo dyes in foodstuffs, as a derogation to the European Parliament and Council Directive 94/36/EC on food colourings, in accordance with paragraph 4 of Article 100A of the EC Treaty.
</p>
<p class="contents">The Commission is at present completing its examination of the comments relating to the Swedish request, forwarded by other Member States. The Commission is therefore likely to consider this matter during the month of March.
</p>
<p class="contents">In view of the Court of Justice's work schedule, it is more than likely that the Commission will decide on this matter before the Court gives a ruling on the preliminary issue mentioned by the Member.

<p class="contents">During the debate on Mr Jove Perez' report on the reform of the olive oil COM, the Commission already indicated that if it were to propose a new system based on flat‐rate aid, it would adopt measures to ensure that production could not be abandoned, in order to resolve the employment problems which might arise in some regions of the Community, particularly in Andalusia.
</p>
<p class="contents">The Commission also emphasized the need to make regional adjustments to the average flat‐rate aid established on an overall level, in order to take into consideration the local employment situation.

<p class="contents">Subject: Possible ban on the use of fishmeal

<p class="contents">A European Commission consultation paper on meat and bonemeal appears to favour a ban on the use of fishmeal as animal feed.
</p>
<p class="contents">Does not the Commission feel that such a ban should only be considered if there is compelling evidence that fishmeal poses a risk, and is the Commission aware of any such evidence?

Question No 115 by Alan Gillis (H−0109/98)</span> </span></p>
<p class="contents">Subject: Fishmeal in ruminant feed
</p>
<p class="contents">Although I understand the reasons behind the Commission's proposal to ban fishmeal in ruminant feed because it is an animal protein, it would appear that the underlying basis for such a ban is one couched in fear of another BSE crisis, although there are no scientific grounds for this.
</p>
<p class="contents">It has on the contrary been scientifically proved that selective use of fishmeal increases fertility in dairy herds and reduces lamb mortality rates.
</p>
<p class="contents">Is the Commission overreacting to consumer fears in the wake of the BSE scandal, and will it review its proposals for a ban as there is no scientific evidence that such feed presents a risk to bovine or other livestock?
</p>
<p class="contents"><span class="italic">
<span class="italic">
Joint Answer</span> </span></p>
<p class="contents">In November 1997 the Commission launched a Consultation Paper calling for further reflection on the future policy of the Community's feed legislation and including the question of a possible ban on the use of all animal protein in the feeding of ruminants, on the grounds that these animals are herbivorous and therefore do not need animal protein in their diet. The Commission is aware of the economic impact of such a measure, in particular for the fishing industry and for farming in Europe.
</p>
<p class="contents">Moreover, the Commission has currently no evidence of health or welfare problems associated with the use of fishmeal. At any rate, the use of animal proteins in the feeding of ruminants raises questions, due to the fact that it represents a departure from natural ways of feedings, which perhaps could lead to favourable epidemiological conditions for the development of new pathogenic agents.
</p>
<p class="contents">Besides, the Commission knows the high nutritive value of fishmeal as the best source of high‐quality protein, the amino acids methionine and lysine and various other beneficial components of the diet. The Commission also accepts that fishmeal can play an important nutritional role, particularly for high yielding animals. A complete, well‐balanced diet contributes to the animal welfare and to the physiological functioning of animal organisms.
</p>
<p class="contents">The intention of the Consultation paper is to offer the possibility to governments, professional sectors, scientists, associations, farmers, individuals etc. to comment on the present situation and the possible consequences of adopting different approaches. The Commission is now examining all information and comments that have been submitted and will publish its conclusion in the near future.

Question No 116 by Gerard Collins (H−0103/98)</span> </span></p>
<p class="contents">Subject: Gas pipeline to Ennis and Shannon
</p>
<p class="contents">Last September, the Irish Government submitted a proposal to extend the Irish natural gas network to a number of towns, including Ennis and Shannon, to the Commission's Competition Directorate in order to allow a full assessment of the state aids aspects of this proposal to be reviewed by the Commission.
</p>
<p class="contents">Can the Commission now indicate if it has had the opportunity to undertake this assessment and, if so, can it now give its approval to this important proposal? If not, can the Commission give priority to completing its work with a view to an early decision on this matter?
</p>
<p class="contents"><span class="italic">
<span class="italic">
Answer</span> </span></p>
<p class="contents">The question raised by the honourable Member relates to the Commission's examination of a notified individual aid proposal concerning the extension of the Irish natural gas network.
</p>
<p class="contents">According to Article 93(3) of the EC Treaty, the Commission examines if a notified aid proposal is compatible with the common market, and the Member State concerned may not put its proposed measures into effect until this procedure has resulted in a final decision.
</p>
<p class="contents">Until now, the Commission has not yet been able to give its approval to the aid proposal as substantial information was missing. Nevertheless, the case is of high priority and it is the Commission's intention to complete its work with an early decision.

Question No 117 by Alex Smith (H−0105/98)</span> </span></p>
<p class="contents">Subject: Proposal for changes to the common market in bananas
</p>
<p class="contents">Under the proposal for changes to the common organization of the market in bananas, the Commission has proposed to allocate a global quota to ACP States rather than specify individual country quotas.
</p>
<p class="contents">Could the Commission indicate why it does not want to allocate specific country quotas which, after all, is a simple administrative decision which does not run counter to WTO rules?
</p>
<p class="contents">Furthermore, can the Commission justify not allocating individual country quotas – for reasons of administrative convenience – when the allocation of specific quotas would more effectively guarantee and ensure market access for the smaller ACP producers, an objective to which the EU has committed itself under the Convention of Lomé?
</p>
<p class="contents"><span class="italic">
<span class="italic">
Answer</span> </span></p>
<p class="contents">The WTO's Appellate Body ruling on bananas stated that the part of Article XIII of the GATT relating to the allocation of quotas between supplying countries must be respected, as the Community's waiver in respect of its Lomé Convention commitments does not cover this. In order to comply with the WTO ruling, the Commission has proposed that the WTO‐bound tariff quota, the autonomous tariff quota and the traditional ACP quantity should all be allocated using the same criterion, that of granting specific country allocations to ‚substantial suppliers’ which by convention is those countries supplying at least 10 % of imports.
</p>
<p class="contents">The only countries which meet this criterion appear to be Ecuador, Costa Rica, Colombia and Panama, and therefore these are the only countries which would be given individual allocations using this criterion.
</p>
<p class="contents">Even with total allocation to all suppliers, in accordance with the relevant provisions of Article XIII, it would not be possible to maintain the current levels of all the individual allocations to traditional ACP countries.
</p>
<p class="contents">In the Commission's view, the current proposal, which maintains the same overall level of access for traditional ACP bananas, represents the best way of bringing the arrangements for the import of bananas into conformity with the WTO.
</p>
<p class="contents">The Commission's proposal respects both obligations under the Lomé Convention and under the WTO agreements.

<p class="contents">As part of the Understanding reached on 11 April 1997 between the Community and the US on the Helms‐Burton Act and the D'Amato Act the Community agreed to suspend the WTO Panel procedures which it had brought against the Helms‐Burton Act. It is correct that the Panel proceedings may rest ‚suspended’ for a maximum of 12 months, following which the Panel lapses. But after that period the Community may always open new proceedings by initiating new consultations. In the Understanding of April 1997, and in its bilateral contacts with the US, the Commission has always reserved the rights of the Community to resume the Panel procedure, or begin new proceedings, if action is taken against Community companies under either the Helms‐Burton Act or the D'Amato Act or if waivers are not granted.

Question No 124 by Edgar Schiedermeier (H−0111/98)</span> </span></p>
<p class="contents">Subject: Call for tenders in connection with the Leonardo Da Vinci Programme (OJ C 372, 9.12.1997, p. 23)
</p>
<p class="contents">Does the Commission believe that, with this call for tenders, it is fulfilling its obligations with regard to proximity to the citizen, transparency, concentration and efficiency, or does it feel that this more than obscure call for tenders may be compensated by the information days recently held, does it share my concern that such information events principally benefit a small and especially privileged clientele, and does it feel that, by restricting the call for tenders to two official languages, it has guaranteed equal opportunities for all participants?
</p>
<p class="contents"><span class="italic">
<span class="italic">
Answer</span> </span></p>
<p class="contents">1. 
The call for tenders for 1998 (DG XXII/37/97) for the Leonardo da Vinci programme was published in the Official Journal of 17 December 1997 (OJ C 327/23) in the eleven official languages of the European Union, in accordance with the rules of publication in the Official Journal.

</p>
<p class="contents">2. 
The aim of the information days organized by the Commission in Brussels on 19 and 20 January 1998 was not to replace the call for tender but to help future promoters to establish partnerships and to fully understand the priorities and guidelines of the call for tenders published in the OJ. During the information days, over 1 130 participants, from 25 European countries, were able to obtain all the official documentation relating to the call for tender (vademecum, application forms, decision) in the eleven Community languages. They were also able to have individual meetings, in their own languages, with representatives of their national coordinating organizations, the Commission, or the technical assistance office. Furthermore, the national bodies coordinating the programme are organizing information seminars in their own countries and languages, open to all interested future promoters, to help them to prepare their bids. It is therefore wrong to say that this programme will only benefit a small and privileged clientele.

</p>
<p class="contents">3. 
For budgetary and practical reasons, the thematic and practical workshops during the information days were organized in two languages only (English and French). The decision to use two languages was therefore made, with regard to the workshops only, for budgetary and practical reasons, to encourage interactivity and the formation of partnerships.

</p>

<p class="contents">The burial of animal carcases is prohibited pursuant to Directive 90/667/EEC<a href="#def_12_22" name="ref_12_22"><sup>(22)</sup></a>

, although some derogations have been granted. Since 1986, Sweden has had a very good animal welfare and food safety record; for instance, food is practically salmonella‐free, meat‐and‐bone meal has not been used since 1996, and the consumption of antibiotics has fallen by 30 % since 1986.
</p>
<p class="contents">A derogation from the ban on burying animal carcases was initially granted for certain parts of Norrland owing to the absence of high‐risk waste and because the transport of animal carcases poses practical problems in sparsely populated rural areas.
</p>
<p class="contents">What would the Commission's views be on extending this derogation to the whole of Norrland?
</p>
<p class="contents"><span class="italic">
<span class="italic">
Answer</span> </span></p>
<p class="contents">Directive 90/667/EEC laying down the veterinary rules for the disposal and processing of animal waste, allows the burial of animal carcases under certain circumstances.
</p>
<p class="contents">In particular, the competent authorities of the Member State may decide that these carcases may be disposed of by burial where they originate from places with difficulties of access and/or the quantity and the distance to be covered does not justify collecting the waste.
</p>
<p class="contents">The same directive also establishes rules for burial in order to prevent any spread of disease and any contamination of water tables or other environmental nuisance.

<p class="contents">The Commission regrets that the honourable Member finds the Commission proposal amending European Parliament and Council Directive 95/2/EC<a href="#def_12_25" name="ref_12_25"><sup>(25)</sup></a>

<p class="contents">Subject: Green Paper on libraries and the information society
</p>
<p class="contents">Public libraries across the EU are calling on the European Commission to stop putting off launching the debate on their future in the information society originally promised for last year.
</p>
<p class="contents">A public debate on how the Union should tackle issues such as the preservation of work, privacy, copyright liability and universal access to information is vital as the online age begins to challenge the traditional role of public libraries.
</p>
<p class="contents">What are the Commission's intentions and when will the Green Paper on the role of libraries in the information society be forwarded to the European Parliament?
</p>
<p class="contents"><span class="italic">
<span class="italic">
Answer</span> </span></p>
<p class="contents">Since the European Parliament requested the Commission in March 1997 to prepare a Green Paper on the Role of Libraries in the Information Society, a great deal of preparatory work has been undertaken in researching the evolution of public library services in the Member States. This has revealed a number of significant developments at national level indicating the importance most Member States now give to the provision of access to electronic information and support services through public library networks.
</p>
<p class="contents">The preparatory work, which has been carried out in consultation with the relevant organizations in the Member States, seems to indicate that there is wide agreement on the need for generalized access to new information services which will help to avoid the development of a two‐tier division of users. In this context, public libraries will certainly have an important role to play.
</p>
<p class="contents">The Commission agrees that items such as preservation, privacy, copyright and universal access need attention. Some of these are being addressed in other initiatives relating to the information society, for example in connection with work on convergence, on the safe use of the Internet and on the need for international cooperation on electronic commerce. They are also the subject of a number of legislative measures such as the existing Directive on the protection of personal data or the proposed Directive on Copyright and neighbouring rights in the Information Society. The Commission is now in a better position to examine matters that would relate more specifically to the role of libraries in the information society and hopes to complete this work possibly before the summer break.

<p class="contents">The Greek Government has submitted to the Greek Parliament a draft law aiming to abolish collective bargaining over staff regulations in public enterprises – stock market‐listed or not – and government‐subsidized companies. The regulations will in future be laid down by law, which has provoked a huge outcry from the workers involved.
</p>
<p class="contents">In the Commission's view, is this action contrary to the social policy embodied in the protocol to the Treaties, to social legislation and the Social Charter, and to ILO Convention 98 in that it is a flagrant violation of fundamental social and trade union rights, abolishes basic forms of trade union activity and flouts any notion of industrial relations and dialogue? What measures will the Commission take to safeguard these rights and satisfy the workers' just demands?
</p>
<p class="contents"><span class="italic">
<span class="italic">
Answer</span> </span></p>
<p class="contents">The situation described by the honourable Member of Parliament falls within the exclusive competence of the Member State concerned. There is no Community legislation on the conduct of collective bargaining at national level, and as long as the rights of workers laid down by Community law are respected, the Commission has no competence in the matter.
</p>

<p class="contents">The Commission shares the concerns of the Jubilee 2000 Campaign regarding debt problems of the poorest countries. It has been increasingly recognized that despite progress made during recent years in providing more generous debt relief measures and despite their efforts to implement economic reforms, a number of the poorest countries are still constrained by excessive external debt burdens.
</p>
<p class="contents">It should be noted that the Community is primarily a donor of grant resources and a very small creditor in this context. Solutions to the debt problems of the poorest countries will require concerted action among all creditors in order to have the necessary impact. The Debt Initiative for the Heavily Indebted Poor Countries (the HIPC Debt Initiative) which was launched in 1996, is a framework for such coordinated action. The aim of this initiative is to reduce the debt burdens of the heavily indebted poor countries to sustainable levels and thereby to support their efforts to implement economic reforms and to reduce poverty. The Commission strongly welcomes this initiative and although the Community is a very small creditor, it is politically very important that the Community participates and plays its part. It is encouraging that the Council has now confirmed the Community participation in this initiative with respect to Community claims on the heavily indebted poor countries.
</p>
<p class="contents">The HIPC initiative is clearly in the spirit of the Jubilee 2000 campaign. It may be less far‐reaching, but is also more realistic, being based on an agreement by governments and multilateral creditors to take action in a concerted way to help those countries which make serious development efforts.

Question No 130 by Vassilis Ephremidis (H−0127/98)</span> </span></p>
<p class="contents">Subject: Massive demonstrations by farmers in Greece
</p>
<p class="contents">Greek farmers have held massive demonstrations all over Greece in recent days in an attempt to safeguard their incomes and their right to continue farming and in protest at the policy of penalizing their resistance which has led to the prosecution of 8000 farmers. Greek farmers are opposed to the Agenda 2000 guidelines and the adverse effects of cutbacks and the abolition of subsidies and other support measures, the constant squeezing of product quotas across the board, the simultaneous increase in the coresponsibility levies and the relentless onslaught against southern produce even before the forthcoming review of the CAP. Another key demand is for immediate measures to reduce production costs by cutting the cost of inputs, which are among the highest in Europe.
</p>
<p class="contents">What measures will the Commission take to meet the demands of Greek farmers, taking account of the fact that the policy being pursued is resulting in the confiscation of property, ruin, unemployment, destitution and the productive and social marginalization of half of the farming families in Greece?
</p>
<p class="contents"><span class="italic">
<span class="italic">
Answer</span> </span></p>
<p class="contents">Agenda 2000 proposes improving the competitiveness of certain products by reducing price support and, on the other hand, increased direct payments. Greek farmers must have misunderstood the proposals when they establish a link to the actual management of market policy instruments such as quotas or levies. Agenda 2000 is presenting balanced proposals for reforming market policy in several sectors, taking into account the particular responsibilities of each sector.
</p>
<p class="contents">Production costs will be reduced with the Agenda 2000 proposals on cereals in all those sectors which use cereals as feedstuff. Moreover, the cost of inputs in general underlay the development of the particular markets. The Commission has always worked on improving the functioning of the internal market. Administrative cutting of input costs does not fall under the Commission's competences.
</p>
<p class="contents">High production costs may result also from structural handicaps. With its current and its future policy on supporting structural adjustment in agriculture, the Community is supporting the necessary adaptations. Within the current Objective 1 Community Support Framework a total amount of ECU 903 million financed by the EAGGF is devoted to Objective 5a measures in Greece. Moreover, farmers can benefit from other adjustments promoted by the accompanying measures (agri‐environmental, afforestation and early retirement schemes) which will be reinforced by Agenda 2000. The Agenda 2000 proposals, in particular the increase in direct payments, the reorganization of rural development policy and the continuation of the Structural Policy Objective 1 programmes will ensure a fair standard of living for the agricultural community and will provide alternative income opportunities in rural areas.

Question No 131 by Reinhard Rack (H−0130/98)</span> </span></p>
<p class="contents">Subject: Assistance to regions bordering the CEECs
</p>
<p class="contents">As a result of the accession of Spain and Portugal in 1986, the structurally weak southern regions of the Community faced serious problems of adjustment, which was why the Integrated Mediterranean Programmes were adopted. A similar problem now exists along the EU's external border with the CEECs, and this was the theme of a conference of representatives of the border regions (from Germany, Finland, Italy and Austria), which took place in Graz on 29 January 1998.
</p>
<p class="contents">Does the Commission have a positive view of an integrated special programme to accompany the EU's enlargement to the east and of targeted priorities in the INTERREG programme for the border regions?
</p>
<p class="contents">What other measures, such as those relating to competition law, does the Commission intend to take to support the process of adjustment in the structurally weak border regions?
</p>
<p class="contents"><span class="italic">
<span class="italic">
Answer</span> </span></p>
<p class="contents">The Commission fully comprehends the specific situation of the regions situated on the EU"s external borders with the CEECs. However, the Commission does not believe that enlargement towards such countries and the resulting opening of markets is necessarily a potential danger or threat to the economies of neighbouring regions inside the Community's present territories. Enlargement and the removal of the existing barriers to free movement at such borders will generate a very significant economic stimulus and will provide new prospects for development.
</p>
<p class="contents">Furthermore, within the scope of the Structural Funds, the Community has been funding the Community initiative, INTERREG, since 1990, and is now funding INTERREG II relating to the development of border areas and cross‐border cooperation. Amongst other things, the aim of this initiative is to respond to the external border areas' new situation and to make the most of it. In fact, the regions along the present external borders between the EU and the CEECs are taking advantage of this initiative to develop their indigenous potential, use new opportunities resulting from the removal of the Iron Curtain and improve their economic competitiveness.
</p>
<p class="contents">As well as some changes in the management of the Structural Funds, which will enable the Member States to take specific problems into consideration, the Commission has included a section relating to cross‐border cooperation in the Community initiative ‚Agenda 2000’, for 2000‐2006. The initiative will be an appropriate instrument for responding to the possible need for structural adaptation in the regions affected by enlargement. The Commission will ensure that the initiative is as flexible as it needs to be, and that it is used to ensure that the future enlargement of the Community is of real benefit to border regions, which will become regions with internal borders. On the other hand, the Commission has not planned any specific Community initiatives in favour of such regions, or any special instrument comparable to the integrated Mediterranean programmes of the 1980s.

<p class="contents">Subject: EU support to drugs policy organizations for preventive health measures
</p>
<p class="contents">In both 1996 and 1997, EU financial support was given to organizations such as European Cities on Drug Policy (ECDP), whose aims include the legalization of drugs, the opening of 'coffee shops' and the legalized prescription of heroin. Yet European Cities Against Drugs (ECAD), an association of 180 European towns and cities opposing liberal drugs policies, received no support whatsoever.

<p class="contents">Subject The Commission's views on drugs policy
</p>
<p class="contents">Drugs‐related crime and drug abuse fall within the remits of several Commissioners. Mrs Gradin is responsible for measures that fall within the third pillar, whilst Mr Flynn is responsible for social measures designed to combat abuse, and Mrs Bonino has also been involved in the drugs policy debate. All three of them have given the impression of holding contradictory views on the legalization of soft drugs and damage‐reduction measures such as methadone treatment and the legalized prescription of hard drugs. I wrote to the President of the Commission in November 1996 to find out what line the Commission actually took, but have received no reply.
</p>
<p class="contents">In 1997, European Cities Against Drugs (ECAD) applied for a grant from the EU for information campaigns, training and staff exchanges. This organization is an association of 180 European towns and cities that share a common aim of a drugs‐free society. Its application was turned down, but European Cities on Drug Policy (ECDP) was awarded a grant. The ECDP's aims include free hash, open drug markets, the opening of 'coffee shops' and the legalized prescription of hard drugs.
</p>
<p class="contents">Commissioner Gradin has on several occasions said that she opposes the legalization of drugs. Is Mrs Gradin the Commissioner responsible for such matters and, if so, are her views also the Commission's official views. If not, should responsibility for all drugs‐related issues not therefore be brought within the remit of just one Commissioner?

Question No 134 by MaLou Lindholm (H−0162/98)</span> </span></p>
<p class="contents">Subject: Rejection of application for funding of ECAD (European Cities Against Drugs)<br/>In the light of the Commission's rejection of ECAD's application for SEK 1.5 million in funding for 1997, will the Commission state its reasons for doing so? How does the Commission explain the past and present bias towards the liberal approach to drugs in the allocation of funding for preventive measures? Does the Commission consider such bias to be consistent with the EU's antidrug action programmes, for example? If not, what does the Commission intend to do to redress the balance in the allocation of funding between the two approaches, liberal and restrictive? Does the Commission consider it proper to support projects etc. which are contrary to those UN Conventions that the EU claims to endorse and which the Member States have ratified?
</p>
<p class="contents"><span class="italic">
<span class="italic">
Joint Answer</span> </span></p>
<p class="contents">The European Union's action plan to combat drugs (1995‐99) constitutes the reference framework for activities conducted in this field by the EU and its Member States and has no bias in favour of a legalization approach towards illegal drugs.
</p>
<p class="contents">The Commission emphasizes that the objectives of the Community action programme for the prevention of drug dependence incorporates the prevention of associated risks. The activities proposed in this field by the ‚European Cities on Drug Policy’ network were examined in accordance with the arrangements, criteria and procedures for selecting and financing projects, and were supported after consultation of the Committee established by the Decision setting up the programme, in view of their tie‐in with certain priority measures under the programme.
</p>
<p class="contents">The Commission regrets to have to inform the Honourable Members that it has not received an application for financial support form the ‚Europe Cities Against Drugs’ network. The Commission invites all organizations active in the field of drug demand reduction to submit projects of Community interest, which are examined on the basis of their contribution to the objectives and priorities of the programme.
</p>
<p class="contents">In line with the modus vivendi and the Commission's commitment to transparency, proposed measures connected with the ‚drug dependence prevention’ programme have been and will continue to be forwarded to Parliament. This included information on the projects given support.
</p>
<p class="contents">The Commission does not consider that the projects currently receiving support are contrary to the United National Conventions. It wishes to point out that legislation on drug use is exclusively the responsibility of the Member States.
</p>
<p class="contents">As far as the different aspects of the drug issue dealt with by the Commission are concerned, they fall – as in the Member States – within the responsibility of several Commissioners. Effective co‐ordination of the actions to be pursued and coherence of the approach are monitored by a specific co‐ordination unit of the General Secretariat of the Commission.

Question No 135 by Concepció Ferrer (H−0136/98)</span> </span></p>
<p class="contents">Subject: Relations between the EU and Equatorial Guinea
</p>
<p class="contents">On 21 January 1998 a number of still obscure events took place on the island of Bioko (Equatorial Guinea), which appear to have involved numerous members of the Bubi ethnic group being arrested and tortured, while the threat of the death penalty is hanging over four former Spanish ex‐legionaries of Equatorial Guinean origin arrested following those events. In December 1997, the EU sent a mission to Malabo to evaluate possible democratization measures carried out in Equatorial Guinea, which had the opportunity to obtain a first‐hand picture of events.
</p>
<p class="contents">Is the Commission in a position to establish the real impact of these events?
</p>
<p class="contents">Does it consider them to be compatible with the undertakings by President Obiang on measures to promote democratization in Equatorial Guinea?
</p>
<p class="contents"><span class="italic">
<span class="italic">
Answer</span> </span></p>
<p class="contents">On 21 January, several military installations were attacked near the capital, Malabo, on the island of Bioko, and several soldiers and civilians were killed. The incident lead to a wave of arrests amongst the supporters of the Movement for Self‐Determination of the island of Bioko, a illegal movement of the Bubi ethnic population, which makes up the native population of Bioko. The government believes that the attack was carried out by Bubi separatists with the support of a neighbouring country, and has affirmed that the perpetrators will be judged transparently and according to the law. It has also confirmed that it does not intend to change the intended dates of the legislative elections in 1998.
</p>
<p class="contents">The Commission is aware of the difficulties involved in the democratization process in Equatorial Guinea, particularly with regard to the fundamental freedoms of the opposition. It is monitoring the political development of the country very closely and will continue its talks with national authorities, with a view to advancing and consolidating the fragile process of democratization.
</p>
<p class="contents">The Commission will maintain the agreed conditions for gradual resumption of cooperation with Equatorial Guinea, using the resources of the 7th EDF, that is, real progress with regard to human rights, democratic principles and the rule of law, in accordance with Article 5 of the fourth Lomé Convention.

<p class="contents">Part of the strategy of Agenda 2000 in the beef sector is to exploit the market in South East Asia. In view of the recent serious economic problems that have arisen in this market, does the Commission now consider that it can maintain its optimism for EU beef exports to SE Asia, taking into account also the fact the cattle prices in Argentina and Australia are expected to remain substantially below EU prices?
</p>
<p class="contents"><span class="italic">
<span class="italic">
Answer</span> </span></p>
<p class="contents">The price reduction proposed in the beef reform included in Agenda 2000 should bring Community beef market prices closer to the prices of the other beef exporting countries in the world. This will be completed at the end of the transitional period provided for the introduction of this reform, i.e. in the year 2002. It should make it possible for part of Community exports to the traditional markets to take place without a refund, and to gain some new markets. The Commission still considers this as a realistic forecast.

<p class="contents">Subject: Unpasteurized milk

<p class="contents">Does the European Commission believe that unpasteurized milk presents a potential hazard to human health and should therefore be banned from sale in the Member States?
</p>
<p class="contents"><span class="italic">
<span class="italic">
Answer</span> </span></p>
<p class="contents">Direct consumption of unpasteurized milk has in the past been the cause of numerous cases of food poisoning, tuberculosis and brucellosis infection in humans.
</p>
<p class="contents">The Commission is aware of the risks of the consumption of unpasteurized milk, which is why, in 1991, the Commission submitted a draft directive on health rules for the production and marketing of milk and milk‐based products which was adopted by the Council in 1992 (Directive 92/46). The directive establishes a number of specific health rules, which considerably reduce the health hazards of the consumption of unpasteurized milk. Although there is no such things as zero risk in this area, the Commission can, if necessary, reinforce the measures, by adopting further animal health and hygiene measures for the production of unpasteurized milk for human consumption. Pending the adoption of such conditions, Member States can maintain stricter conditions, including banning the sale of unpasteurized milk.
</p>
<p class="contents">Within the framework of the simplification of the veterinary directives and their consolidation with the food hygiene directive requested by Parliament, the Commission will consider the best measures to adopt in order to ensure the lowest possible risk to public health.

Question No 138 by Roy Perry (H−0145/98)</span> </span></p>
<p class="contents">Subject: Tobacco
</p>
<p class="contents">The levels of tobacco tax are different in all the Member States of the European Union, with the highest being in the UK. This has resulted in a large amount of smuggling between the continent and the UK. How significant are the differing levels of tobacco tax in restricting the free movement of goods?
</p>
<p class="contents">There is an increasing amount of tobacco smuggling within the European Union as a result of differing levels of tobacco tax, specifically the UK's high tax compared with Belgium's lower taxes. The sale of tobacco products by smugglers is not regulated, meaning that children have greater access to these products. To what extent is the European Union's objective of reducing tobacco consumption undermined by the sale of tobacco products to under‐age children by smugglers?
</p>
<p class="contents"><span class="italic">
<span class="italic">
Answer</span> </span></p>
<p class="contents">It is indeed true that the levels of taxes on tobacco products are different in the Member States. However, these differences in tax levels do not restrict the free movement of goods and thus are not a constraint on the functioning of the internal market.
</p>
<p class="contents">Under the harmonized Community rules which have been in force since 1 January 1993, excise duty on tobacco products normally has to be paid in the Member State of consumption. For commercial movements this means that goods are normally moved from one Member State to another under suspension arrangements and it is only when they are released from such arrangements in the Member State of final consumption that duty becomes chargeable.
</p>
<p class="contents">On the whole, it would appear that, as far as legitimate trade is concerned, this system operates relatively well despite the large differences in excise duty rates between Member States. The fact that tobacco products can be traded under suspension of duty means that rate differences do not lead to any significant distortion of choice or competition on the part of companies involved in trade at this level of the distribution chain.
</p>
<p class="contents">As far as purchases by private individuals are concerned, under the principles of the internal market, tobacco products purchased for individuals' own use and transported by them from one Member State to another are subject to excise duty and VAT in the Member State in which they were acquired. Provided that the goods are indeed for their own use, there is no restriction at all on the freedom of individuals to carry out such purchases.
</p>
<p class="contents">The smoking prevention efforts at the Member State and Community level are described in the Commission's Communication of 18 December 1996<a href="#def_12_27" name="ref_12_27"><sup>(27)</sup></a>

, which has since been the subject of discussions in the Council, in the European Parliament<a href="#def_12_28" name="ref_12_28"><sup>(28)</sup></a>

 and in the Economic and Social Committee<a href="#def_12_29" name="ref_12_29"><sup>(29)</sup></a>

.
</p>
<p class="contents">A policy of increasing price tobacco products through fiscal and other measures is an important part of a smoking prevention strategy, and is particularly significant in dissuading young people from beginning or continuing to smoke. The issue of the relationship between smuggling and the need to reduce tobacco consumption was examined at a recent international seminar in Finland in January 1998, and this issue will be kept under review by the Commission.

Question No 139 by Karin Riis‐Jørgensen (H−0148/98)</span> </span></p>
<p class="contents">Subject: Reinstatement of monopoly of telecommunications services
</p>
<p class="contents">In Denmark, the telecommunications company Tele Danmark has launched the dual concept consisting of a fixed/mobile service which builds on the access network owned 100 % by Tele Danmark.<br/>Tele Danmark has offered to be the service provider for competing mobile operators by proposing a similar solution to them. However, this solution involves charging and service terms that are not competitive, e.g. the onward connection costs are three times higher. Tele Danmark is marketing the dual concept as follows: 'If you have a mobile phone with a different operator than Tele Danmark Mobil, you must of course switch to us in order to enjoy all the benefits of Duet. We can also help you find the right new mobile number'.
</p>
<p class="contents">To what extent does this reinstatement of the monopoly contravene the general principles of free competition enshrined in the Treaty of Rome and the Union?
</p>
<p class="contents"><span class="italic">
<span class="italic">
Answer</span></span></p>
<p class="contents">Tele Danmark is a dominant undertaking in the sense of Article 86 EC as regards the provision of the fixed voice telephony service. It is therefore fully subject to the prohibitions of this Article as regards possible abuses of its dominant position. Tele Danmark is also subject to the provisions of EP and Council Directive 95/62/EC on the application of Open Network Provision to Voice Telephony.
</p>
<p class="contents">A new converging service combining a fixed and mobile subscription and services appears to offer a number of advantages to customers, such as one telephone number for both services, one itemized bill, etc. However, where such services are introduced by dominant operators, the impact for competitors both on the fixed and mobile telephone markets would have to be assessed. In particular, the possibility of offering such services would have to be open to all fixed and mobile operators on a nondiscriminatory basis, and cross‐subsidies by the incumbent to its mobile operation would have to be excluded. The latter would in any event require complete transparency in their accounts, which under certain circumstances may only be possible if the mobile operation of the incumbent is a separate legal entity.
</p>
<p class="contents">In any case, such issues are also of the competence of the National Regulatory Authorities and the National Competition Authorities and the Commission would in principle not take action as long as these Authorities are investigating possible recourses against the offer of such combined services.
</p>
<p class="contents">In the specific case referred to by the Honourable Member, which appears to be the first of its kind but likely to be followed shortly in other Member States, the Commission will contact both the Danish Telecommunications Regulatory Authority and the Danish Competition Authority, and will investigate the details of the arrangements in the context of the competition rules, if necessary.
</p>
<p class="contents">As a general measure, the Commission has launched a Community wide investigation into the interconnection charges between mobile and fixed operators; the findings will be relevant in the context of the newly emerging dual fixed/mobile services.

<p class="contents">In Austria 'monitoring fees' have to be paid to the executive at such highly popular sporting events as ski races, cycle races and marathons open to the public. They impose a considerable financial burden on organizers of such events and on sports associations.
</p>
<p class="contents">If these fees differ among the various EU countries, the choice of venue for sporting events is bound to be influenced.
</p>
<p class="contents">Can the Commission say whether these monitoring fees differ among the EU Member States and if so, whether the resulting distortion of competition is compatible with the legislation of the EU internal market?
</p>
<p class="contents"><span class="italic">
<span class="italic">
Answer</span> </span></p>
<p class="contents">The Honourable Member Paul Rübig has asked a question concerning charges levied in connection with sporting events in Austria.
</p>
<p class="contents">The Commission would like to point out that charges levied locally in connection with a single event are not subject of harmonization at Community level. The charge seems not to be taxation in the meaning of Article 95 of the EC Treaty, which prohibits fiscal discrimination of products form other Member States.
</p>
<p class="contents">A fee collected by public authorities for the delivery of a certain service does not constitute state aid under Article 92(1) of the Treaty. On the contrary, state aid might be involved if a Member State grants services to certain undertakings without asking for an adequate remuneration.

Question No 141 by Inger Schörling (H−0155/98)</span> </span></p>
<p class="contents">Subject: Trade union rights
</p>
<p class="contents">At the request of the European Council Summit Meeting in Amsterdam, the Commission has drawn up a proposal for a Council Regulation introducing an intervention mechanism for the Commission to remove certain obstacles to trade.
</p>
<p class="contents">The aim is to secure freedom of movement for goods within the internal market, which is one of the Community's fundamental principles. So as to prevent infringements of the principle of freedom of movement, which may arise through requiring licences or technical certificates, stopping products by obstructing transport on motorways, at airports or ports, for instance, the Commission wishes to be able to intervene quickly and request Member States to take measures to remove the obstacles. Member States will have between three and five days to submit their views. If a Member State does not comply with the Commission's decisions, the Commission may take the matter further to the Court of Justice.
</p>
<p class="contents">The EU has no jurisdiction in this area and the Regulation is proposed on the basis of Article 235.
</p>
<p class="contents">Does the proposal imply that the Commission can force Member States to intervene in strikes and lockouts? The trade unions are highly critical of EU interference with fundamental trade union rights and intervention in trade union disputes. Does the proposal not jeopardize dialogue between the two sides of industry? How will the right to strike be guaranteed?
</p>
<p class="contents"><span class="italic">
<span class="italic">
Answer</span> </span></p>
<p class="contents">In adopting a proposal for a Council Regulation, introducing an intervention mechanism for the Commission to remove certain obstacles to trade, on 18 November 1997, the Commission intended to respond to the Amsterdam European Council's request as efficiently as possible, The proposed intervention mechanism does not affect any fundamental rights, such as the right to strike, nor does it interfere in social dialogue at national level. In fact, the existence and exercising of the right to strike is guaranteed under national laws and as such is not affected by Community law.
</p>
<p class="contents">The Commission would like to emphasize that the aim of the proposal is to ensure that the Member States involved take the necessary, commensurate steps available within their own legal systems to quickly remove the serious obstacles observed by the Commission, thereby safeguarding the free movement of goods. In this respect, the Commission would like to remind the Member that in a judgment of 9 December 1997, the Court of Justice ruled that a Member State's failure to take action against individuals whose actions create barriers to trade is incompatible with Article 30 of the EC Treaty, pursuant to Article 5 of the EC Treaty.

Question No 142 by David Bowe (H−0156/98)</span> </span></p>
<p class="contents">Subject: Mutual recognition for teachers in the European Union
</p>
<p class="contents">On behalf of the National Union of Teachers in the UK and the Educational Institute of Scotland, Coopers and Lybrand recently produced a report entitled 'European Comparisons in Education Funding'. This report revealed that there is a considerable disparity between Member States as regards the career progression for teachers, despite the fact that there is seeming agreement on schoolteachers' initial pay and status.
</p>
<p class="contents">Is the Commission concerned that such a disparity could effect mutual recognition of teachers' qualifications and experience and thus their ability to move freely around the EU?
</p>
<p class="contents"><span class="italic">
<span class="italic">
Answer</span> </span></p>
<p class="contents">The Commission is aware of the diverse features and modalities for career progression of teachers in the Member States. On behalf of the Commission, Eurydice has prepared several editions of ‚Key Data on Education’, which clearly documents this diversity. Key Data 1997 chapter G is fully dedicated to teachers. In order to implement the transparency principle concerning the different education systems, the Commission has produced a Green Paper on Mobility, in which the various obstacles hampering teachers mobility are pinpointed. An action plan indicating possible paths to overcome these obstacles will be presented.
</p>
<p class="contents">The Commission respects, in accordance with Article 126 of the EC Treaty and in accordance with the principle of subsidiarity, the complete responsibility of the Member States in this field. It is in the framework of this diversity that the Member States have the full competence and responsibility in modifying the conditions necessary for easing teachers' free movement around the Community. Hence, each Member State is entirely free to regulate a profession on its territory and to determine the level and the contents of studies required to gain access to the profession in question.
</p>
<p class="contents">However, the national rules must respect the Community directives on the recognition of qualification. In the case of teachers, Directive 89/48/EEC on a general system for the recognition of higher education diplomas awarded on completion on education and training of at least three years' duration applies. Recognition obtained according to this directive confers upon the migrant the right to apply to teaching posts in the host Member State on the same conditions that apply to holders of national diplomas, i.e. with the same rights and the same obligations.
</p>
<p class="contents">In absolute terms, teachers represent the largest single professional group to have benefited from this directive. According to the figures supplied by Member States towards the end of 1994, more than 5, 100 teachers have obtained recognition of their teaching qualifications in another Member States, but of these 3, 800 were recognized in the United Kingdom alone.

<p class="contents">Is the Commission aware of a recent report drawn up by Coopers and Lybrand, commissioned by the National Union of Teachers and the Educational Institute of Scotland which examined 'European Comparisons in Education Funding'?
</p>
<p class="contents">One of the most important findings was that no country is entirely satisfied with their provision for children with special/additional educational needs. What is the Commission doing to aid the Member States in their search for better provision for these children?

<p class="contents">The Commission has supported the action of the Member States since 1987 by implementing three Community programmes relating to the integration of disabled people, and their education in particular. The first programme and the programme HELIOS I contributed towards improving our understanding of the educational situation of disabled people in the Member States. In the programme HELIOS II (1993‐1996), 192 exchange activities divided into thirteen subject groups provided opportunities for cooperation and the publication of subject brochures describing the present situation along with recommendations to improve the conditions enabling disabled people to receive education. The final seminar, held in Luxembourg in November 1996, drew up a summary of the programme and led to the preparation of the ‚Luxembourg Charter’ which obtained a consensus of opinion on the principles, strategies and proposals of ‚school for all’.
</p>
<p class="contents">In the Community programme on education, Socrates, and in two other programmes – Leonardo da Vinci (training) and Youth for Europe III (actions outside educational structures) – the principle of the European dimension in education recommends the integration of children, adolescents and adults with special needs in the spirit of all actions. In 1997, in a desire for transparency, the Commission supported the processing and distribution of information on a Web site in conjunction with the Europa‐Socrates host, carried out by the European Development Agency for the Education of People with Special Needs (launched by the Danish government in November 1996 and supported by all the Member States). The Commission is also supporting the revision of the report on the present situation of special or integrated educational systems in the Member States, which should be available this spring, and research in conjunction with the OECD on special education indicators, whose results will be published during 1998.
</p>
<p class="contents">During this Presidency, the Commission is supporting a seminar on education for people with special needs (on 7 May in Windsor). However, responsibility for the implementation of any measure relating to the organization and content of educational systems falls within the competency of the Member States.

Question No 144 by Mihail Papayannakis (H−0984/97)</span> </span></p>
<p class="contents">Subject: Plant protection products<br/>Directives 91/414<a href="#def_12_30" name="ref_12_30"><sup>(30)</sup></a>

 and 90/642/EEC<a href="#def_12_31" name="ref_12_31"><sup>(31)</sup></a>

 prohibit the use of plant protection products where they might have undesirable effects on public health and the environment; they also require the Member States to take appropriate measures to control and review the marketing and use of such products.
</p>
<p class="contents">According to Ministry of Agriculture agronomists and academics, government controls in Greece are piecemeal and inadequate, pesticide residues are above safety limits and there is insufficient consumer information.
</p>
<p class="contents">Since recent European research shows that 5 % of cases of cancer are caused by the use of plant protection products, will the Commission say whether Greece has complied with the above Directives as amended, as it should have done for years, and what measures it will take to bring Greek legislation into line with Community law on these points?
</p>
<p class="contents"><span class="italic">
<span class="italic">
Answer</span> </span></p>
<p class="contents">Concerning controls on marketing and use of plant protection products, Directive 91/414/EEC provides that Member States have to make the necessary arrangements to check officially their placing on the market and use in accordance with the provisions of the directive. The Directive leaves however to each Member State to regulate the detailed organization of those controls, and to determine the intensity with which they are performed; it provides only that Member States send each year a report on the controls made.
</p>
<p class="contents">In the preceding years Greece has satisfied this requirement. The Commission is considering, whether in the framework of a future amendment of Directive 91/414/EEC or otherwise a strengthening of the provisions concerning controls has to be provided.
</p>
<p class="contents">With regard to the monitoring of pesticide residues in agricultural commodities, the Greek authorities have also submitted in recent years the report on their residue monitoring program, as required under Directive 90/642/EEC. The reports of the Member States are under examination by the Commission with a view to making recommendations for more effective monitoring in the forthcoming years.
</p>
<p class="contents">The Commission considers that the amendments to Directive 90/642/EEC on the fixing of maximum levels for pesticide residues in and on certain products of plant origin, including fruit and vegetables<a href="#def_12_32" name="ref_12_32"><sup>(32)</sup></a>

 made by Directive 97/41/EC<a href="#def_12_33" name="ref_12_33"><sup>(33)</sup></a>

, due to be implemented by the Member States by 31 December 1998, will provide a framework for increased effectiveness of the arrangement for inspection and monitoring of pesticide residues. The Commission intends to make detailed implementing rules necessary for the proper functioning of the amended provisions before that date.
</p>
<p class="contents">The Commission can also indicate to the Honourable Member that it recently received from the European Environment Bureau a study ‚Pesticides and Cancer’. The Commission submitted this study for further consideration to the Scientific Committee for Plants.
