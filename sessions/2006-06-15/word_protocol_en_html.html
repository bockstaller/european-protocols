Mr President, ladies and gentlemen, Article 96 of the Rules of Procedure provides that our activities shall be made public, and therefore I believe that it is important to acknowledge the possible consequences of the statements made in this Chamber too.</p>
<p class="contents">I refer to the declaration made by Mrs De Keyser on Monday concerning the eight deaths in Gaza, a declaration in which she claimed – I quote word for word – that the killings were a deliberate act and that, in 1987, the first Intifada was started by a less serious incident.</p>
<p class="contents">Since this statement, which met with applause in this House, has been disproved by an Israeli investigation from which it turns out that the incident was probably caused by a bomb, I believe that, in our capacity as Parliament, we should be more circumspect when faced with news of this kind and wait to hear how the events actually unfolded, because, otherwise, our statements are liable to have repercussions that we do not want. </p>

 Mr President, ladies and gentlemen, with regard to this report on fraud for the year 2004, we should keep in mind that the irregularities, and I stress again that these are irregularities and not fraud – since fraud usually only makes up a fraction thereof – remain relatively stable at hardly 1% of the EU budget. It is of course interesting that within the budget there are certain shifts that may be observed over the medium term and the long term. In this connection, we above all welcome, and can even note with pride, the fact that in recent years we have achieved massive reductions in irregularities in our biggest area, namely agriculture. From 2003 to 2004, losses were reduced by approximately 50%, from EUR 170 million to EUR 80 million. Conversely – and unfortunately – we have to note that losses from the Structural Funds have increased from EUR 482 million to EUR 694 million.</p>
<p class="contents">We can unanimously ascribe the receding figures for agriculture to the fact that the Integrated Administration and Control System is obviously having an effect. Wherever it is applied, there are positive results; so of course we must insist even more firmly that the InAdCo System is indeed applied. In our report we note critically that, as long as seven years after the expiry of the implementation deadline, an old Member State, namely Greece, has not yet applied it. Of course we encourage the Commission to attend to this matter, because these methods of proceeding must be applied across the board.</p>
<p class="contents">The next point to attract our attention relates to pre-accession aid. Everything that has to do with enlargement is politically sensitive, but we have to make sure that, in this area too, things are done properly in budgetary terms. The extent of the suspected irregularities is cause for concern, but far worse is the fact that the Commission, by its own admission, does not really know what kind of irregularities these are, and consequently does not know either what is recoverable or how it may be recovered – and this in as many as 90% of cases.</p>
<p class="contents">In other words, the Commission is practically blind in this affair, and so we must take precautionary steps. We know that the administrative capacities of the accession countries are indeed somewhat smaller, but I would ask Parliament and the Commission to take this into consideration in future budgets. We do not want to pour extra water into barrels that are already full, since in the end this will cause them to overflow.</p>
<p class="contents">In last year’s report on the fight against fraud we dealt with cigarette smuggling as a top priority, and we are – frankly – proud that important work has been done here by the Commission and by OLAF. Twenty-four countries, including the new Member States, have now entered into the agreement with Philip Morris – with one exception, which we regret: Great Britain. We would certainly like the Commission to spend the payments due from Philip Morris – in total around EUR 1 billion – in a sensible way, and we think it regrettable that, so far, it has been unable to do so. The Commission should provide concrete suggestions and initiatives for the use of this income.</p>
<p class="contents">We estimate that, in the EU in 2004, cigarette smuggling caused the loss of customs revenue worth around EUR 418 million – and this trend is set to increase. This is an issue that needs to be solved at European level. Measures taken by Member States will be of little use.</p>
<p class="contents">For the first time we have also included VAT fraud. We estimate that Member States lose 10% of VAT revenue every year through VAT fraud, and I would like emphatically to urge the Commission to take this matter further in conjunction with the European Parliament and to support it in doing so.</p>
<p class="contents">Finally, I turn to the imminent reform of OLAF. On 24 May the Commission adopted the proposal for a regulation; however, even now it has not yet passed this on to Parliament, and so the parliamentary process cannot yet begin. Today, we shall, however, propose some clear guidelines on this issue. Thus, for example, Parliament will not agree to any regulation that restricts its rights in any way.</p>
<p class="contents">As far as OLAF’s work is concerned, priorities have increasingly shifted in recent years away from OLAF’s original primary task, namely that of carrying out investigations, and towards coordination functions and providing a platform. Expansion of coordination activities must definitely not occur at the expense of investigations, since the outward effects of this could be fatal. If the discussion on reform is to include a possible extension of OLAF’s activities, then the Commission and this House must be clear from the beginning that this will necessitate further financial and human resources. We both need to come to an agreement about this. </p>

<span class="italic">Member of the Commission. </span>
<span class="bold"> </span>
<span class="italic">(CS)</span>
 Mr President, ladies and gentlemen, the Commission would first like to thank the rapporteur, Mr Bösch, for the way in which he has dedicated himself for years to the fight against fraud, and to protecting the financial interests of the European Union.</p>
<p class="contents">We have here one of the most positive reports on this area in recent years. The report is of course a reflection of reality. The Commission welcomes this constructive report and supports most of the views expressed in it.</p>
<p class="contents">I would like first of all to mention the statistics and trends in respect of discrepancies reported by the Member States in 2004. We must always guard against drawing hasty conclusions from the statistics relating to these reports. Member States that report large numbers of cases are generally trying harder to meet their obligations than the States reporting fewer cases. The sums are also estimates and do not reflect budgetary losses, since correctional measures are implemented immediately.</p>
<p class="contents">In the areas of own resources and agriculture the sums are falling, as has already been stated, while in the area of structural activities they are increasing. As Parliament has emphasised, the IACS system has had great success in the area of agriculture. The Commission is striving not only to reduce the number of discrepancies and the steps applying to them, but has also undertaken measures in 2005 through which some of the old Member States have improved the way they report discrepancies, through the use of electronic systems.</p>
<p class="contents">I would now like to focus briefly on the contents of the report. Concerning the reform of OLAF, the European Anti-Fraud Office, the Commission adopted a proposal on 24 May 2006 to amend Regulation 1073/1999, under which OLAF was established. What are the main elements of the OLAF reform? It is necessary first to state that, in respect of carrying out investigations, the Office is an operationally independent unit of the Commission, and its existing structure is functioning well. The Court of Auditors confirmed this fact in its special report on the establishment of the Office. In this context the proposed legislation would make the investigative activities of the Office and its political administration more effective, while respecting procedural and individual rights during investigations and transfers of data relating to investigations, and also retaining the independence and confidentiality of the Office’s investigative activities. The Commission believes that this is a well-balanced proposal, the aim of which is to improve the way the Office operates, and the effect of which really will be to bring about such an improvement.</p>
<p class="contents">The Commission hopes that Parliament will be able to give some thought to this proposal as soon as possible, as the first discussions have already taken place in the Council within the framework of the relevant work group.</p>
<p class="contents">Turning to the fight against cigarette smuggling, I would like to say a few words on this subject, particularly on the agreement against cigarette smuggling that has been concluded with Philip Morris International. The Commission would like to thank Parliament for its unstinting support in this area. The Commission is delighted that 24 out of the 25 Member States have already backed the agreement, the only one not to do so being the United Kingdom. This fact testifies to the success and importance of an agreement which is the first in this area and which establishes cooperation between the authorities and industry.</p>
<p class="contents">The figures for seizures of Philip Morris International cigarettes are of particular significance to OLAF and the Member States. To give you some idea – in 2005 OLAF and the Member States notified Philip Morris of almost 300 individual seizures, amounting to more than 400 million cigarettes. Of this total, 85-90 % were counterfeit. The seizures allow us to identify key areas in the fight against smuggling and counterfeiting, and this is extremely important. In practice the agreement has shown itself to be a highly effective instrument in the fight against cigarette smuggling. The Commission hopes that it will serve as a model for other cigarette producers.</p>
<p class="contents">The report mentioned the issue of how to use the resources obtained. The Commission intends to put forward a proposal in the near future on changes to the Pericles Programme over the years 2007–2013, which will give an important place to the fight against smuggling and counterfeiting as an objective meriting the allocation of financial resources.</p>
<p class="contents">The report justifiably took up the particular problem of VAT fraud in the Community and the significant losses accruing to the Member States. All efforts aimed at intensifying cooperation between Member States and between the Commission and the Member States deserve maximum support. The proposed procedure dealing with mutual administrative assistance, to which Parliament has given a positive response, is an important initiative.</p>
<p class="contents">When will OLAF, as a unit of the Commission, be able to provide the Member States with added value? This initiative falls neatly into the framework of the communication on a European strategy for the fight against tax losses, adopted by the Commission on 31 May. It states that the level of tax losses is becoming an increasing concern, and that the Member States cannot act effectively in isolation. The aim of the Commission is to improve the mechanisms for practical cooperation between individual Member States and between the Member States and the Office.</p>
<p class="contents">As you can see, there are a whole series of important legal measures under preparation at present, or under discussion with the Council and Parliament. At many different levels, all of these measures will strengthen the protection of financial interests and secure improved cooperation between various bodies. The area of protection for financial interests is an area of shared authority, and the Member States have a decisive role to play in making it succeed. The Commission and OLAF hope that Parliament will continue to be a powerful ally in this project. An effective structure for combating the misuse of European finances is fundamental to winning the trust of citizens. The trustworthiness of our official bodies is all the more important now that it has been so difficult to reach agreement on the new financial perspectives.</p>
<p class="contents">Allow me to express a view on the individual amendments. The Commission can accept Amendments 1, 3, 4 and 5. In the case of Amendment 2, on Eurostat, the Commission submitted a situation report on 12 April 2006 dealing with the Eurostat affair. The report indicated that the range of measures approved should guarantee that similar discrepancies will not recur. OLAF has completed all but one of the inquiries. Concerning the financial effects of the discrepancies and reimbursement of the debts, the Commission is not able at the moment to provide any information additional to that which is in the report. Some matters are still under discussion in national courts, and it is therefore not possible to provide more exact information.</p>
<p class="contents">In the case of Amendment 6, the Commission believes that the internal system for excluding firms which it currently has in place answers this demand sufficiently. This system is available and is maintained by all of the Directorates General in the Commission and not just by the Directorate for Research. The idea of a blacklist as an instrument for prevention is really promising. For this reason, the Commission has proposed within the framework of the revised Financial Regulation to extend the database of excluded firms so that Member States can use it too, along with the other partners involved in administering Community funds. The problem with this amendment from the perspective of the Commission is not its abstract internal essence, but the fact that it is only a partial proposal within the framework of a wider system which is under development, which is effective, and whose further development is still an open question, in the opinion of the Commission. </p>

 I would like to begin by congratulating my colleague Mr Bösch for his report, which, as the Commissioner also said, is a good and positive report and that will receive our support. I would like to make two brief points.</p>
<p class="contents">Firstly, now that we have confirmed the appointment of the Head of OLAF, I would like to send the message that we should let this office go about its work without putting any spokes in its wheel. The OLAF is a vital office in the struggle against fraud and it is therefore important that we let it work in peace and not under continuous pressure and tension from our part. We need to open a new chapter and allow OLAF to work. Then, if OLAF does not provide results, we can return to the discussion.</p>
<p class="contents">Secondly, the Commission has just put forward new proposals for revising the regulation concerning the setting up of OLAF. We have great interest in this process and we would like to see this change bring a much stronger, much more efficient and much more effective office. However, this should also include the independence of OLAF.</p>
<p class="contents">Mr President, our group gives great importance to the protection of the European Union's financial interests, for the simple reason that we must show a clear commitment to ensuring that taxpayers' money is not only used properly but is also shown to be used properly. Given that the European Union is using taxpayers' money, this is our duty. </p>

Mr President, I would like to join in the general acknowledgement of the work of my fellow Member Herbert Bösch, of his determination to protect the Community’s financial interests and his monitoring of the activities of OLAF.</p>
<p class="contents">This year we are pleased, therefore – myself in particular, in view of the references to aspects of agriculture that involve my country – with the clear improvement and the quality, as well as the reduction in fraud in the Member States and, in particular, the success achieved with regard to contraband cigarettes, which demonstrates that the Union is able to impose itself on those multinationals that sometimes appear to be impossible to control.</p>
<p class="contents">This year, however, we also have a new aspect which is very worrying and in relation to which we all – but especially the Commission – have to show greater responsibility: is respect for the fundamental rights of the people being investigated guaranteed? I say this because the judgement of the Court of First Instance of 6 April 2006 in the IRELA Affair, which demands that the Commission pay compensation to a civil servant and which roundly condemns the investigation carried out by OLAF, requires that we reflect and react in a profound and radical manner in order to ensure that the revised Regulation on OLAF investigations, which is being prepared for presentation, irrefutably and clearly guarantees the independence of the control of the legality of the investigations carried out and, above all, maximum respect for the fundamental rights of the people investigated, in full application of the principle of prevention.</p>
<p class="contents">Our Union, the Communities and our institutions cannot lecture the countries around us, and our own Member States, on respect for people’s fundamental rights if here we are not able to maintain that principle of prevention and respect for the fundamental rights of the people working here when they are subject to investigation. Afterwards is always too late. </p>

 Mr President, Commissioner, ladies and gentlemen, a parliament has many tasks. Not only does it draft and simplify laws, but it also monitors certain decisions and the question whether those decisions have been carried out correctly. One of those core monitoring tasks is to inspect the implementation of the budget: it has to check whether the more than EUR 100 billion which is used to carry out European policy has been spent well and correctly, whether European taxpayers’ money has been used wisely and efficiently and whether it ends up in the right hands.</p>
<p class="contents">For the 2004 budget year, the irregularities and fraud reported by the Member States amounted to nearly EUR 1 billion. Whilst, in the past, we could see that most of those cases pertained to agriculture and to a lesser degree to expenses in structural policy, we can now, as Mr Bösch rightly said, detect a buck in the trend: there are now more reports in respect of the Structural Funds, and fewer regarding agriculture. This drop within agriculture is, of course, wholly attributable to the effectiveness of the integrated control system. Against this backdrop, I should like to emphasise that it is unacceptable that one Member State, Greece, should still remain in default seven years after the event.</p>
<p class="contents">Mr Bösch has managed to aptly summarise what has gone wrong, and he has not minced his words in doing so. He used the extremely efficient method of naming and shaming, and quite rightly so. Partly thanks to the support of the anti-fraud Commissioner, Mr Kallas, in the past year, we managed to force a number of Member States to publicise the final beneficiaries of the agricultural funds. That has given us a good insight into the spending pattern of agricultural funds and into the anomalies. More than anything, it taught us once again that the funds do not always end up with the farmers, but with major food giants.</p>
<p class="contents">I think that we should now take things one step further and force the Member States to publicise the final beneficiaries of the Structural Funds, including the Regional Development Fund and Social Fund. I should also like to use this debate to pay tribute to the people of the European Anti-Fraud Office, OLAF. They are doing sterling work, although they have sometimes come under criticism. Mr Bösch is right in mentioning in his report a number of negative points, but we should always remember that enormous progress has been made over the past eight years.</p>
<p class="contents">I should like to finish off by saying a few words about two very fraud-sensitive areas, namely VAT fraud and cigarette smuggling. VAT fraud must be addressed, and I welcome the Commission’s communication in that respect. With respect to cigarette smuggling, I will be publishing an own-initiative report later on in the year. I am delighted that, despite the fact that an own-initiative report will be issued, Mr Bösch has already devoted a number of paragraphs in his report to this very issue. We have struck a deal with Philip Morris, and the money that we generate from this deal should be ploughed back into anti-fraud policy. As Commissioner Špidla was right in saying, I think that we, along with the Commission, must examine how those funds should be used, for example in the Hercules programme. We will need to put much of our time and energy into this in the coming months. </p>

 Mr Bösch, first of all, thank you. What now though? In 2004, nearly 10 000 irregularities were reported involving European funds, but those are, of course, only the cases of fraud and incompetence that we know about. We can only guess at the exact level of fiddling that goes on behind our backs involving European money. I myself fear that this is only the tip of the iceberg against which the ship of the European Union is bound to shatter into pieces. The European citizen is becoming ever more critical of the EU, and money wasting is one of the main reasons for this justified criticism. Two per cent of the Structural Funds are spent on fraud or some other form of mismanagement. Given the enormous sums involved, I find this a very worrying percentage, as it translates into hundreds of millions of euros wasted, at least 20% of which, according to the Commission, is accounted for by direct fraud – self-enrichment at European, national and regional level. It is necessary, in my view, to carry out a Europe-wide assessment of the effectiveness and fraud sensitivity of, in particular, the European Social Fund.</p>
<p class="contents">The European anti-fraud office OLAF should commit to fighting fraud in Europe as its main task. Unfortunately, in many cases, this guard dog has often emerged as nothing but a lap dog. One characteristic of this situation is the fact that Parliament is still in the dark about the extent and implications of the Eurostat fraud that came to light back in 2004. This is completely at odds with the efficiency and transparency which the Commission claims to pursue in this communication.</p>
<p class="contents">However, it would be unfair, where failing fraud control is concerned, to point the finger at Brussels alone, because the Member States are certainly just as guilty. They turn a blind eye to fraud or do not come down hard enough at any rate. It is unacceptable that the lion’s share of fraud cases should occur in old, relatively rich Member States, including Germany and Spain, and that, moreover, those countries should submit incorrect and incomplete reports on fraud cases on their territories. A clear tit-for-tat policy should apply here: if Member States fail to address fraud and the waste of European funds adequately, this should have consequences in terms of the level of funds they receive. That also applies to my own country, the Netherlands, by the way, when it refuses to name specific perpetrators in fraud cases. Even more important is the prevention of fraud. This can be done by simply cutting off the most fraud-sensitive money streams, for example export subsidies in agriculture, for it is a well-known fact that many of the fraud cases take place in that area. Apart from all other moral objections I have to export subsidies, this seems to be an excellent reason to put an end to this ridiculous and harmful form of support. </p>

 Mr President, the protection of the Community’s financial interests and the fight against fraud require an effective control system, which the European Union does not have.</p>
<p class="contents">I have the utmost regard for the European Court of Auditors, but its reports give a very superficial picture, and in reality we do not know very much about how EU money is actually spent. Basing budgetary control on the DAS system, or in other words on issuing positive statements of assurance on the reliability of the accounts, does not allow abuses to be uncovered. For this reason, abuses are more frequently uncovered by the press than by the appointed control bodies. What is worse, the European model is recommended to Member States and in Poland, for example, I have noticed that the greater the similarity between budget execution reports prepared by the Supreme Chamber of Control and the reports of the European Court of Auditors, the less real information they contain about irregularities and abuses that are occurring.</p>
<p class="contents">We should seriously rethink the system for budgetary control in the European Union; its reform should move in the direction of increasing control. Not only checking the reliability of accounts, but also checking specific irregularities and abuses, analysing their causes and making recommendations for their rectification, and also recognising and highlighting mechanisms fostering corruption should become key parts of the system of control in the European Union. We should also create the necessary conditions so that the European Parliament can use reports from national control bodies, in which a huge amount of information regarding the spending of EU money is included, which we have not been using at all up to now. This matter should be resolved systematically.</p>
<p class="contents">Mr President, we are talking about abuses, so please permit me a small verbal abuse of my own, namely one sentence on another subject: it is precisely in this House that my country, Poland, has been accused of racism and xenophobia. I would like to express my complete rejection of this accusation and to say that in Poland for many years nobody has even had a hair…</p>

 Mr President, Mr Bösch has carried out a very conscientious and, in certain respects, brilliant survey of irregularities and fraud taking place in various parts of the European Union and in a number of its authorities. It is, however, one thing to discover what is going on and another subsequently to ensure that action is taken to remedy the situation. It is the main task of this House to demand accountability. Parliament is not, however, fulfilling its task in this area.</p>
<p class="contents">Firstly, we must be able to determine who is responsible. Many of us in this House have tried to implement an arrangement whereby, in each country, a cabinet minister or other minister appends his or her name to a guarantee that EU resources have been used correctly in his or her own country. As a result, that politician is known to be accountable. Secondly, we must demand accountability once we have discovered who is responsible. Parliament should do this by refusing to grant discharge when there are problems. This is not being done. There are hidden connections of which we are unaware. As rapporteur, I myself found unsatisfactory states of affairs in the Committee of the Regions and requested that we postpone the decision on discharge, but almost everyone voted against this proposal. Only the Group of the Alliance of Liberals and Democrats for Europe changed sides, which is to their credit, while the Socialist Group in the European Parliament and the Group of the European People’s Party (Christian Democrats) and European Democrats refused, as usual, to demand accountability. This is a situation that must be changed. </p>

 Mr President, if anyone is seriously interested in this whole area – and it is, after all, a matter of protecting the financial interests of the Community – then I would recommend him to read about how this House has already discussed this matter on similar occasions and, above all, to read what amendments have been discussed in the Committee in the run-up to the report and then later not adopted. More specifically: this report does no more than barely scratch the surface of the fundamental problems in this Union. If we go the heart of the matter, then we are not dealing with 1% irregularities, but with much greater funds that are – at the very least – not being spent in a sensible way. I am thinking of the EUR 5 to 7 billion for Tacis and many other areas, for example administration, where money is wasted.</p>
<p class="contents">This report, therefore, is so limited that it amounts to little more than a smokescreen, because it does not address the really essential questions. Even the rapporteur himself says that nobody has any idea what kind of irregularities we are dealing with when it comes to enlargement. Despite this we admit new countries, because the crux of the matter is that the institution that is actually supposed to deal with irregularities is potentially a great embarrassment for Parliament. The Commission has, accordingly, made proposals on how OLAF is to be reformed. Clearly, this report falls short of those proposals. Amendments have been rejected, demanding that OLAF should work in a proper, reliable and comprehensible manner – at least in the limited areas in which it has been active until now. However, all of these demands were rejected by the Committee. Now we are told that it is great that we have already got so far.</p>
<p class="contents">No, we have not got that far yet, not by a long chalk. In so far as investigations are carried out at all, they are arbitrary. When people act as if they are prosecuting fraud, but then fail to do so, these procedures are unconstitutional. We are faced here with an absolutely crucial problem for this Union: namely, that money is simply being wasted in many areas. Most of you know this, but we should not pretend that this report is going to bring about a great improvement. </p>

 Mr President, Commissioner Špidla, ladies and gentlemen, OLAF and its officials deserve our thanks and our appreciation for doing a very difficult and very important task. The result can be seen clearly: OLAF is an important and powerfully effective partner for Europe in the fight against fraud. I would like to invite Mr Martin to back up his accusations of allegedly unconstitutional procedures.</p>
<p class="contents">It is in our vested interest that OLAF, as part of the budgetary authority, always grows stronger as a partner. However, if we now review the last fifteen months, then actually the Commission has not done very much to strengthen OLAF. Long-drawn-out appeal proceedings were heard; with the result that institutions were weakened and people were damaged. Now it is announced that OLAF is to be strengthened. The European Parliament will watch over the independence of OLAF with Argus eyes, according to the new legal bases. I would sincerely ask the Commission to formulate the draft so that it may be judged in these terms. We shall carefully scrutinise it, to see how serious the Commission really is about fighting fraud. The more independently OLAF is conceived in the draft, the greater the Commission’s interest in combating fraud.</p>
<p class="contents">I would like to assure you of our support. There are many other initiatives being worked out that are directly aimed at combating fraud, for example the Green Paper on the transparency initiative, and the question of whether to publish the names of the recipients of subsidies or at least to make them public, to bring them to the attention of the Commission. We have a first draft that includes these things, I mean the Budget Regulation which is present in draft form. Now, for everybody’s sake, we must send a reminder to the Council about this and follow it through, otherwise the fight against fraud will remain incomplete and be a toothless tiger. </p>

 I too should like to congratulate our rapporteur on his outstanding report and to express my support for most of the remarks that have been made on various sides of the Chamber. I especially welcome the remarks made by my fellow group member Mr Staes, who rightly raised the issue of farming, a major problem area in the context of the Community Funds.</p>
<p class="contents">Most importantly, I wanted to say to the Commission, face to face, that it is crucial that the condemnation of OLAF by the Court of First Instance in Case T – 309/2003, as my fellow group member Mrs Ayala Sender has brought to our attention, be followed up by action. This is not just a matter of forcing the Commission to provide compensation for a Commission employee. What we must do is condemn a whole series of investigation procedures carried out by OLAF, which failed to comply with any of the rules that must be followed under the rule of law, which failed to uphold the principles of exemption and impartiality, which failed to give the accused any opportunity for defence, and which, lastly, ensured that an investigation – an absolute fiasco – was directed against people who had absolutely nothing to do with the affair, rather than against the true culprits.</p>
<p class="contents">This is not right, and if it is conducted in this manner I must state very clearly that I do not understand what the Commission's transparency policy is trying to achieve. This must be followed up by action. Under no circumstances can a society governed by the rule of law sanction such a Court ruling without action being taken. </p>

 Mr President, in speaking in this debate I would like to turn your attention to what, in my opinion, are the most important issues.</p>
<p class="contents">The first of these is the ever-increasing level of activity in the Member States in terms of uncovering irregularities and abuses relating to European Union funding, although there are unfortunately countries among the old Member States which pass on information regarding abuses to the Commission several years late.</p>
<p class="contents">The second issue is the clear fall of over 50% as regards confirmed losses in agriculture expenditure, from about 170 million in 2003 to 82 million in 2004. This deserves special mention owing to the fact that European Union agricultural aid has several million beneficiaries. The possibility of irregularities and abuse is therefore potentially very high.</p>
<p class="contents">The third issue is the disturbing growth in losses relating to the Structural Funds, from EUR 482 million in 2003 to close to EUR 695 million in 2004, and mainly in the old Member States.</p>
<p class="contents">The fourth and final issue is the huge scale of losses suffered with regard to own resources in connection with the growing incidence of smuggling, mainly of tobacco products, trade in fake goods, and also VAT abuses. According to estimates by experts, the latter account for as much as about 10% of all revenue from VAT in individual countries. In turn, losses resulting from increased smuggling require additional funds for securing customs borders, particularly on the European Union’s eastern borders. </p>

 Mr President, a bit less fraud here, a bit more fraud there. This report is a sad catalogue of failure – failure to direct enormous amounts of EU funds to where they were intended. But this is just one of the ways in which EU funds are wasted. Despite all the apparent good intentions, a large proportion of the cash is spent on daft projects that advertise the EU or support the disgraceful common agricultural policy; and all this has spawned a whole industry of bureaucrats who exist merely to produce the relevant paperwork for applying for and dealing with the grants. Another huge waste.</p>
<p class="contents">EU money is easy money – provided you fill in the forms nicely, or forge them. The whole system has fallen into contempt. Where is the incentive for Member States to use their own resources to police the use of the funds? Let us stop fussing about how we achieve marginal reductions in what we call fraud, and instead think more deeply about the true value that is added by all this misuse of EU taxpayers’ cash. </p>

 Mr President, instead of constantly looking for new sources of funding, for example in the form of new EU taxes, and instead of constantly increasing the level of expenditure, it is in my view high time to intensify the fight against fraud and waste. It is precisely during the payment of EU grants – made at appropriate points throughout the Member States – that irregularities occur time and time again. What is remarkable is the increase in fraud cases in several Member States of the EU. Member States should, finally, either resolve their lack of administrative capacity in this regard or be made to make good the losses that arise from it. In my view it is indeed important that we optimise OLAF and constantly look for new solutions to improve our fight against fraud. However, all these changes will achieve little if OLAF dossiers are not rapidly processed, because the responsible officials in the Member States are overworked, and if the recovery of erroneously paid funds is not handled rigorously. In my opinion, we must, finally, act decisively so that the fight against fraud does not just remain a pious wish. </p>

Mr President, the report addresses the issue of cigarette smuggling comprehensively. It is very important to fight against cigarette smuggling, because it does not only endanger our financial interests, but consumer health, too. Smuggling poses a particularly serious problem in Hungary, because taxes are significantly higher than in neighbouring non-EU states. By now, this has resulted in a 25% increase in the market of untaxed cigarette products, causing huge damage to the Hungarian budget.</p>
<p class="contents">Cigarettes are smuggled from Ukraine, Romania and other Balkan states. I wish to mention emphatically that duty free shops are operating on the Romanian side of the Hungarian-Romanian border, where travellers can purchase cigarettes to bring them in duty free, often in order to sell them in Hungary and other European Union Member States. In view of the imminent accession of Romania, the Romanian Government should close down these duty free shops immediately.</p>
<p class="contents">However, smuggling will continue to be a problem even after the accession of Romania to the European Union, because Romania was granted transitional exemption in order to reach minimum tax levels; this means that we will have to monitor continuously whether Romania is able to enforce the excise regulations of the European Union, and whether it is able to prevent smuggling to other Member States, such as neighbouring Hungary. Obviously this does not affect tobacco products only; it is also an important issue for the market of alcoholic beverages, due to the disorganisation of the Romanian market and the transitional exemption. </p>

 The irregularities in the management of EU finances to the tune of millions or even billions of euros exposed by Mr Herbert Bösch in his report have been a disappointment. In this context, I would like to reiterate that the report deals with the year 2004, and hence irregularities in the new Member States accounted for but a fraction of the mismanaged amounts. Thus, there is all the more reason for us to regard these revelations as a challenge. If the old Member States with their long-term experience have not been able to ensure adequate transparency in dealing with EU public funds, there is no doubt that similar deficiencies can be anticipated in the new Member States. Extremely disconcerting are the reported data on the quantities and value of smuggled cigarettes and branded counterfeit products, resulting in major financial losses to the Community. The European Union’s eastern frontier is most vulnerable in this regard, especially in the stretch where Slovakia and Poland border on Ukraine and where Poland borders on Belarus.</p>
<p class="contents">I therefore urge that greater attention be paid to the protection of those regions and to thwarting illegal trafficking. By the same token, I would like to point out that the regions in question are the poorest in the European Union and that the extent of smuggling is indirectly related to their economic situation. Ladies and gentlemen, losses and irregularities affecting Structural Funds have increased dramatically during the period under consideration. In 2004 these increased by 44% over 2003, totalling almost EUR 700 million. This is both a warning and a challenge for us all. The challenge, on the one hand, is to take effective steps targeting the affected Member States and, on the other, to identify systemic solutions that would safeguard the Community’s financial interests against fraud and other forms of illegal activity. </p>

Mr President, I would like to thank Mr Bösch for a fine report. The report represents work of a very high quality, as is always the case when Mr Bösch is involved.</p>
<p class="contents">We are aware, unfortunately, that the EU has a problem of legitimacy. The EU has an image problem when it comes to how it administers taxpayers' money. This problem is the result of two facts. The first of these is the simple fact that fraud involving EU funds does take place. The other is that there is not enough transparency. Clearly, this sets a number of challenges for the institutions – the European Parliament, OLAF and the other EU institutions. Firstly, what is of course needed to solve the problems that exist is, quite simply, better monitoring. Secondly, the situation calls for greater transparency.</p>
<p class="contents">I recently read an article in a Danish newspaper bearing the headline ‘Everyone is talking about transparency, but no one is doing anything about it’. I believe that, unfortunately, this article was truly symptomatic of the view that the European people have of Europe. Everyone talks about transparency. We all want transparency, but we do nothing about it. Fortunately, something is happening. Fortunately, the Commission is currently in the process of taking an initiative whereby it is to be obligatory to publish the names of those receiving agricultural subsidies. This is a step in the right direction. We would like the same principle also to apply to Structural Fund resources. It should, of course, be the case that every journalist, every citizen and everyone else can log on to a website very easily and very simply and see the names of those receiving the Union’s money.</p>
<p class="contents">More also needs to be done, however, in relation to monitoring. We in the Socialist Group in the European Parliament acknowledge that the integrated financial control system works well, but we do believe, at the same time, that it is a problem that the system has still not been fully implemented, more than seven years after the date by which it was supposed to have been implemented. The same applies to resources from the Structural Funds, where there is likewise a lack of satisfactory monitoring.</p>
<p class="contents">It is very easy to forget such things when discussing the great developments of European cooperation. For example, are we to have a Constitutional Treaty? Is Turkey to join? Yet the truth is that these questions are incredibly important in terms of achieving legitimacy in the eyes of the people of Europe. For purely idealistic reasons, too, we should of course be working to ensure that every single euro paid by European taxpayers is responsibly administered and to ensure that this is done in a transparent manner. </p>

 Ladies and gentlemen, allow me to express my great appreciation for the debate that has just taken place, as it relates to matters of exceptional importance. It is unquestionably true that the credibility of the European Union depends to a large extent on how reliably and effectively European financial resources are used.</p>
<p class="contents">The report clearly marks a step towards the better and more effective use of resources and towards reducing the risk of misuse of these latter or of financial fraud.</p>
<p class="contents">Allow me to take up just a few points that were raised in the discussion. There were some expressions of concern that the independence of the European Anti-Fraud Office (OLAF) might be undermined. I have to say that the opposite is true in respect of the Commission proposals that have been presented for debate in Parliament. That risk will not arise, and I feel sure that our debate will be far-reaching and will show that the Commission proposals do not point towards any weakening of the independent position of OLAF.</p>
<p class="contents">Similarly, the highly important question of procedural rights and procedural requirements was raised. Here too I can state that the Commission proposal is in line with the views expressed in the debate, namely that there is a need to reinforce some elements relating to, for example, the transfer of information on investigations, independence and operational confidentiality in such a way that the rights of those involved are respected, in accordance with the legal principles of the European Union.</p>
<p class="contents">Ladies and gentlemen, allow me also to touch briefly on the Eurostat problem. This case is still open, and until all of the proceedings have been completed it will not be possible to quantify the results precisely in the normal way, but this will be done as soon as the situation becomes clearer.</p>
<p class="contents">Ladies and gentlemen, allow me to state the common interest of the Commission and Parliament in seeing that we progress further down a route that will ensure that Europe’s financial resources are used in an effective and wholly honest way. </p>

</p>
<p class="contents">The South African delegation is headed by Mr Obed Bapela, President of the House. The delegation itself is composed of eight members, representing the country’s diverse political tendencies. This is the first time since 1998 that we have had the pleasure of welcoming our South African counterparts here, in Europe.</p>
<p class="contents">South Africa and the European Union share the belief that international problems must be resolved by means of multilateral solutions. They also share common social and political values. Both are actively engaged in supporting peace and stability and in combating poverty throughout the whole continent of Africa. We hope at present to reinforce further the parliamentary dimension of our cooperation.</p>
<p class="contents">I have been informed that your meetings at the European Parliament have been crowned with success. I hope that you pursue your mission successfully, and I also wish you a safe journey home. </p>

Mr President, I would like to thank all the Members of the European Parliament for their excellent and fruitful cooperation. We had 1700 amendments, so the interest in the Seventh Framework Programme was huge.</p>
<p class="contents">I would particularly like to thank my colleagues from the Committee on Industry, Research and Energy, who put in the most work. Cooperation with the shadow rapporteurs was excellent, and I should like to thank my colleagues for their cooperation. The Commission officials and political group advisors also put in a lot of work.</p>
<p class="contents">Thanks to the Seventh Framework Programme, we want to exploit the potential of all the 25 European Union Member States. We want to take advantage of the experience of the best people and infrastructure. The European Parliament has acted quickly, effectively and responsibly. We must not slow down the pace. We must launch the programme on 1 January 2007, and this is my call to you.</p>

 Mr President, even though you made some jokey remarks about this MIFID arriving in the European Parliament, I should like to say that it is not just a technical issue that we are adopting today. This is the first time Parliament has really increased its powers when it comes to delegated legislation in the field of comitology. We have been trying to get more powers when we are dealing with delegated legislation on comitology. It was a disgrace for Parliament that the issue was debated as the last item on yesterday’s agenda. Getting those powers was a historic moment for the European Parliament. We have to fight strongly for those powers, especially now, when we are renegotiating the comitology agreement and interinstitutional agreement. I know that every political group backs these extra powers for the European Parliament. It is not a technical issue.</p>

) Mr President, I would in fact like to propose a simple structural change to paragraph 2, in order to render it more balanced and thereby to give it more force. At the moment we have a general introductory phrase followed by a list of examples. I propose removing the second part of the sixth indent and adding it to the introductory phrase, so that the call to punish those responsible applies to all the national authorities. I also propose adding the word ‘hate’ to paragraph 2, which would give, and I shall read out the beginning to you: ‘strongly condemns all racist and hate attacks and urges all national authorities to do everything in their power to punish those responsible and to fight the climate of impunity with respect to such issues’ and so on. </p>

Mr President, in fact, in order to be consistent with one of the amendments that we have adopted, the oral amendment consists of adding Spain to the list of countries where there have recently been serious cases of violence, of violations of rights on racist and xenophobic grounds. This is the reason for the oral amendment and the reason for incorporating it. I would therefore insist, also in order to be consistent with what we have said: it is not a question of condemning a country, but rather an event that has taken place in a country and which has happened recently. </p>

 I do not know if my explanations will be as clear as yours, Mrs Roure, but our Rules of Procedure are very clear. As soon as a Member proposes an oral amendment, if thirty-seven other Members rise to oppose it, then it is not included. It is as simple as that. </p>

<p class="contents">I am sure that Member States will also welcome this proposal, as it will significantly reduce their work load.</p>

 Ladies and gentlemen, I am greatly disappointed by the European Parliament’s stance on ethical issues. In particular, I disagree with the funding of research using live human embryos for reproduction purposes – this is prohibited in some Member States and contravenes the protection of human life and dignity from conception to natural death. Despite these reservations, I have voted for the Buzek report on the Seventh Framework Programme, as I realise how important it is for the future of Europe and Europe’s bid to become the most competitive global economy.</p>
<p class="contents">I regard this Programme as something like a guide to the Lisbon Strategy. It gives me hope that allocations for R[amp]D will help Europe retain its research brainpower and that it will be put to use to develop high-quality projects aiming to improve EU citizens’ quality of life in the environment, transport, energy and healthcare sectors. Allow me to use my own country as an example. Slovakia is relying on the Seventh Framework Programme, among other things, to complete the construction and deployment of a Cyclotron Therapy Centre. This facility will be used to treat various forms of cancer with in-depth proton irradiation, which happens to be far less invasive than conventional radiotherapy. To date, more than 40 thousand patients have been treated using this highly effective state-of-the-art therapeutic technique. </p>

Mr President, I would like to congratulate the European citizens and the researchers on the approval of the Buzek report on the Seventh Framework Programme.</p>
<p class="contents">I believe that it offers hope to everybody who believes in basic research, with the creation of the European Research Council, and in the most advanced pioneering research, despite all of the risks it involves.</p>
<p class="contents">I also believe that it offers support to small- and medium-sized businesses and also hope to everybody who depends on research in the field of health, something on which great emphasis has been placed and for which the budget in this programme has been increased, and furthermore with the support of the all of the political parties.</p>
<p class="contents">I believe that we are in a situation of hope. We must now encourage researchers to join the project, urge the universities and the regions to join in this common task, so that we can thereby work together to benefit everybody.</p>
<p class="contents">Furthermore, it is a much more flexible and open programme than previous ones and it has enthusiastically introduced the humanities, historical heritage and other aspects of culture. Congratulations to everybody. </p>

Mr President, a broad – practically unanimous – consensus was reached by this House this morning on the Seventh Framework Programme. As we know, Europe is making a significant economic effort in line with the Lisbon Strategy.</p>
<p class="contents">My fellow Members will have noted the breadth of the debate stirred up by Article 6 on bioethics, in relation to which the compromise amendment tabled by the Committee on Industry, Research and Energy was accepted by a margin of little more than 40 votes, which is certainly a substantial, but not a majority, margin. At the same time, more stringent amendments on this subject, such as, for example, the amendment tabled by Mrs Niebler on stem cells, which seemed more reasonable to some of us, were rejected by less than 20 votes.</p>
<p class="contents">The Italian delegation from the Margherita party supported these amendments. With this explanation of vote, I intend to highlight the fact that the intense debate stirred up by an issue that, in reality, involves less than 1% of our resources should prompt Parliament and the Commission to adopt the precautionary principle, so as not to underestimate the impact of this matter on public opinion, to which we refer when we seek consensus for Europe. </p>

I regret the fact that Mrs Niebler’s proposal on the ethical issues was rejected. The Austrian People’s Party delegation declares itself clearly opposed to destructive embryo research. </p>

Mr President, in my opinion, the nuclear lobby is attempting to worm out further billions for nuclear energy projects by means of untenable promises of a clean, safe and environmentally-friendly energy solution and by withholding the true costs.</p>
<p class="contents">Nuclear research budgets are seven to eight times greater than the amount of money spent on renewable energies and renewable energy sources. If the actual costs – for example, those relating to the disposal of nuclear waste and the consequential costs of possible radioactive contamination – are included, it would become clear that nuclear energy is not only extremely dangerous but also unprofitable.</p>
<p class="contents">In my opinion, no new money should be allocated to nuclear energy. Instead, this money should be given to extend renewable energy sources and improve energy efficiency. </p>

I used my vote to endorse Amendments 354 and 352 as a means of opposing funding of research activities aimed at the cloning of human embryos. The proposal from the Committee diminished the safeguards in the original Commission proposal by allowing the funding of research on so-called supernumerary embryos, with no prohibition on funding activities which would be contrary to the Oviedo Convention (i.e. cloning for research and germ-line intervention). I also strongly hold that national standards and legislation must not be overridden or diluted by EU activities, including EU-funded research. </p>

The European Parliament’s decision at first reading is a disaster. Parliament has not succeeded in setting the EU Commission clear, ethical limits regarding research policy. The close nature of the vote result gives cause for hope, however, that this can be rectified in Council and at second reading.</p>
<p class="contents">It is a sign of inadequacy that Parliament has not used the opportunity to support ethically straightforward and very promising alternatives. It is unacceptable to lower human embryos to the level of raw material. There is the risk of the commercialisation of human life and the orchestration of women for the purpose of egg donation. Moreover, the funding of research into embryonic stem cells could undermine trust in the EU if values such as human dignity and human rights are so obviously subordinated to financial interests.</p>
<p class="contents">It would be outrageous to continue to expect German taxpayers to finance projects prohibited under German law. Already in the current Sixth Framework Programme, six projects are being funded, in contravention of promises made to the European Parliament, which do not comply with German legislation.</p>
<p class="contents">The Council is now on the ball in terms of correcting this precarious ethical situation. The Federal German Government must make it clear that it contradicts the principle of subsidiarity and that it is very problematic to cofinance research funding of this nature which is ethically highly emotive, and which is not in accord with Germany’s legal position. </p>

I endorse the call set out in the Buzek report for the continuation of the INTAS programme and for its activities to be funded from the specific ‘Cooperation’, ‘People’ and ‘Capacities’ programmes. INTAS is the only pan-European, EU-funded programme dedicated to scientific cooperation with the NIS countries, including involving the scientific community in Ireland and Northern Ireland. It should be continued.</p>
<p class="contents">The Research and Training Networks should also be continued, particularly the flexible support they have given under FP5 and FP6 to a positive mix of both ‘early-stage researchers’ and ‘experienced researchers’. Early-stage researchers benefit greatly from the practical support and advice from more experienced researchers. Mobility of researchers also tends to be high when there is a mix of such researchers. This approach should also be continued. </p>

) The growth and competitiveness of the Union depend in great measure on its ability to develop research and innovation. In 2000 in Lisbon, the Heads of State or Government promised to promote a knowledge-based Europe and, from 2010, to set aside 3% of GNI for this.</p>
<p class="contents">Mr Buzek’s report – that I voted for on Thursday – emphasises the objectives and the challenges of the Seventh Framework Programme for RTD. Two chapters stand out in particular in my mind, concerning regional development: the Regions of Knowledge and the support for SMEs. It is necessary to reinforce the research potential of regions of the Union by encouraging regional research clusters that link universities, research centres, businesses and regional authorities. The report also recommends reinforcing the innovation capacity of SMEs by encouraging them to join networks and by facilitating their access to the Framework Programme.</p>
<p class="contents">In this way the report aims at making research a genuine tool for regional development, even if it is deplorable that the resources allocated to this great European ambition have been reduced by the slimming course that the financial perspectives have undergone. </p>

 I believe that this document is one of the most important in this legislative period, as it addresses the fundamental issue of funding for research projects relating to technological development in a number of different areas of activity.</p>
<p class="contents">In the section on fisheries, I warmly welcome the amendments aimed at providing greater independence in the approach to the sector. Given the crisis facing the sector, these amendments are a positive step.</p>
<p class="contents">Only with more and better technology will it be possible to bring profitability and competitiveness to Europe’s fisheries sector.</p>
<p class="contents">I wish to lend my unequivocal backing to the establishment of a separate heading for fisheries, sustained exploitation of the oceans under the Seventh Framework Programme, and all of the other measures contained in the report. </p>

) For obvious ethical reasons, human cloning must be completely banned. We cannot allow any remaining doubts on this matter. Unfortunately, the Seventh Framework Programme and certain amendments proposed to us today do foster doubt, by only excluding cloning for reproductive purposes from Community funding, and not excluding cloning for therapeutic purposes. This semi-legitimation is dangerous. It is based on the idea that a human being, if not yet developed, may be considered as a simple material, and this is unacceptable.</p>
<p class="contents">What is more, this Programme also provides for the possibility of funding research on embryonic stem cells. I know, although I do not approve of it, that certain Member States of the European Union authorise this. It is inappropriate, in the context of a vote on research funding, to make pronouncements on the legislation of Member States. However, countries that forbid these practices should not be forced to finance them using Community funds, and this type of research should, therefore, not benefit from the resources of the Seventh Framework Programme for RTD.</p>
<p class="contents">This is why we have voted against these provisions, reserving our approval for other research programmes mentioned in the report. </p>

 When we adopt positions on various issues, we must always reflect on whether such matters really should be decided on at EU level, rather than do as we have done in this case and ponder how the EU is to carry through the research that a particular establishment wants to see take place.</p>
<p class="contents">No more money is made available for research just because the Member States send such money via EU authorities. What there is, however, is more bureaucracy and increased costs. Institutional competition between countries with a view to discovering sound solutions leads to quicker progress than does central control at higher levels.</p>
<p class="contents">The question that should instead have been posed is that of what the EU can do for research in Europe that the Member States themselves cannot successfully do. In theory, EU involvement may be limited to areas such as research networks, freedom of movement for researchers within the EU and large-scale research in areas such as energy derived from fusion. Those are the kinds of area to which the EU’s research policy should be limited in accordance with the principle of subsidiarity.</p>
<p class="contents">Thus, we cannot support stem cell research at Community level since it may mean Member States being forced to help fund research that conflicts with national laws in this area. We would, however, point out that we are keen supporters of the laws and rules that apply in Sweden to this type of research.</p>
<p class="contents">Because there has manifestly been no thinking in terms of subsidiarity, the June List has voted against the report as a whole. </p>

 There is a contradiction in Parliament’s position on the Seventh Framework Programme for 2007-2013 in terms of some of the rhetoric surrounding it and of its level of funding. Although the EU purports to be a society geared towards ‘knowledge, research and technology’ there has in fact been a reduction of some EUR 21 million in EU budgetary funding for implementing these objectives in relation to the Commission’s original proposal.</p>
<p class="contents">I also wish to point out that, in the context of the priorities of this Seventh Framework Programme, attempts have been made to view research as yet another ‘product’ to be put on the market, a highly profitable one at that. In other words, in the context of this Seventh Framework Programme we are facing an attempt to commercialise research, to the detriment of public research.</p>
<p class="contents">Although there are positive points raised in the proposal before us today, we feel the priorities of such an important instrument should also include public research in the social, environmental, education and health areas. We are therefore very disappointed with the rejection of a number of proposals aimed at safety at work and the prevention of work-related diseases, and the use of ICTs for sustainable development and social and economic inclusion.</p>
<p class="contents">Hence our vote against. </p>

I totally oppose research on human embryos. I voted for the Gargani/Záborská amendments. These amendments were defeated. Because I believed it served the greater good, I then voted for Mrs Niebler’s amendments as recommended by Mr Gargani (and leading Christian organisations). I did so in the belief that this would have restricted research to stem cells extracted from the human embryo (i.e. the embryo has already been destroyed) prior to 31.12.2003 and that new human embryos could not be created and then destroyed for research purposes.</p>
<p class="contents">I did so in particular because the other two sets of amendments (Committee and Purvis) would be next to be voted on and seemed likely at that stage to be carried. This is the most unacceptable position for me. As both the Gargani and Niebler amendments were defeated, the next amendment (Committee) was passed as I feared. I voted against this. I am not at ease with voting for Niebler but it is a better ethical position than creating new embryos for destruction. Killing someone to take their liver for research is murder. Taking the liver of someone already dead for research is different but still raises huge moral/ethical questions. </p>

In the EU’s Seventh Research Framework Programme, security and defence research is established as a separate budget item for the first time. Starting from 2007, the EU will undertake massive investment in these problematic research areas. Parts of the research budget allocation will still be coordinated with the European Defence Agency (EDA). Defence companies such as EADS and BAE Systems will be able to have a decisive say in how funds are used.</p>
<p class="contents">On the one hand, defence research is designed to establish weapons technology as the leading technology within the Lisbon Strategy. On the other, by means of the massive investment in defence research, a further milestone is achieved in the establishment of the EU rapid reaction corps and EU battle groups.</p>
<p class="contents">Moreover, space research has taken on a military bias. Hence, GMES (Global Monitoring for Environment and Security), which was openly established with a view to enabling the European Union to observe its strategic role, is to be funded.</p>
<p class="contents">History teaches us that rising defence expenditure and, hence, increased funding for defence research, too, is always a sign of further wars and conflicts. Contrary to all assurances of surgically precise weaponry, the number of war victims and, above all, the proportion of civilian victims of war, have always risen the more technically advanced the weaponry. </p>

 The Community’s research and development framework programme is of pressing importance as it is one of the programmes with the highest EU funding.</p>
<p class="contents">Divided into four specific programmes – Cooperation, People, Ideas and Capacities – this framework programme will serve to boost European competitiveness and innovation.</p>
<p class="contents">Of these specific programmes, I should like to highlight the 'Capacities’ component, which will enjoy the highest budget and which plans to involve industry in the research and development of new products and in promoting cooperation with research centres and universities.</p>
<p class="contents">The report also attaches due importance to SMEs, whose involvement is facilitated in this new framework programme by the support role given to technology platforms.</p>
<p class="contents">Lastly, the importance of this programme in the context of regional development comes to the fore, insofar as it provides for involvement with the Structural Funds and refers to the need to take account of the ‘Convergence’ objective regions, which covers almost all of Portuguese territory, when awarding funding. It also provides for local and regional authorities to be involved in the decision-making process as regards the granting of funding for building new infrastructure. </p>

.  I voted for Amendments 352, 353, 354, 355, 356, 357 by Gargani, Záborská et al because they disallow EU funding for human embryonic stem cell research, leaving it up to the Member States to fund from their national budget if they so decide. These amendments acknowledge the exploitative and ethically controversial nature of embryonic procurement and research and recognise that in order to fully respect the subsidiarity principle, EU funds should not be distributed to research that is illegal in various Member States. Nevertheless, these amendments encourage research on other promising and non-controversial stem cell research such as adult and cord blood. These amendments have already been approved by the JURI and FEMM Committees.</p>
<p class="contents">When the Gargani amendments failed to pass, I voted in favour of Amendments 319 and 358 by Niebler et al as a damage-control exercise. These amendments allow EU funding for unethical use of existing embryonic stem cell lines created before 31 December 2003. This is a compromise amendment. It is an attempt at damage control because it removes the incentive to create new embryos for research and would hinder any progression to cloning. </p>

) Aside from the disappointment caused by the decrease in resources, the vote on this report is essential and is a beacon of hope for the world of research, and also for those sufferers who long for progress to be made in such research.</p>
<p class="contents">I would like to denounce the obscurantism of certain conservatives who reject embryo research, despite the fact that it is a source of so much hope. In fact, cutting-edge research in this precise sector has already led to great progress in our knowledge of diseases such as diabetes, Parkinson’s disease and Alzheimer’s disease. Happily, Amendments 352, 354, 319, 356, 357 and 358 by Mr Gargani, Mrs Niebler and Mrs Záborská have been rejected. However, it is very clear that research on embryonic stem cells must take place under very strict ethical conditions.</p>
<p class="contents">Finally, I would like to particularly salute – apart from the rapporteur, Mr Buzek – my colleague and head of the Belgian Socialist delegation, Mr Busquin, who, maintaining the dynamism of his impressive work as European Commissioner for Research, continues to work tirelessly to promote research in the heart of our parliamentary district. </p>

 British Conservatives support the principle of a common approach to civil aviation security across the EU. However, we could not support any extension of Commission competence, which could frustrate the overwhelming case for Member States to determine when there is a need for heightened security measures in their own territories. Neither could we support the extension of the scope of this regulation to in-flight security, nor the extension on competence of the European Aviation Safety Agency, at least until it has proven its ability to operate its current safety functions in a competent and efficient manner.</p>
<p class="contents">For these reasons, Conservatives abstained on the final vote. </p>

 I voted in favour of those amendments that were designed to protect the interests of my constituents in Gibraltar. It is outrageous that common rules in the field of civil aviation security do not automatically apply to Gibraltar because of the ongoing refusal by Spain to recognise Gibraltar as a full part of the European Union. This continued harassment only entrenches, understandably, hard-line views in Gibraltar. I would recommend that any long-term solution is more likely to follow from carrots and not sticks. </p>

 I would like to use my explanation of vote to justify my abstention during the vote on Amendments 90 and 91. It should not be the case that the application of rules in the field of civil aviation security is adopted in the first instance for all airports located in Member State sovereign territories while Gibraltar airport is exempted from this regulation in a rider. How can we talk about a Union when generally applicable laws suddenly no longer apply to certain territories?</p>
<p class="contents">Both Spain and the United Kingdom belong to the European Union. I would like to say that squabbles of this nature should not be dealt with on the back of the European Union nor, in particular, at the expense of civil aviation security, which this report deals with, and which should apply its measures and rules to prevent acts of unlawful interference in relation to civil aviation to all EU airports so as to safeguard the welfare of all passengers. </p>

 I very much welcome the proposal on the table today for common rules in the field of civil aviation. I think it is timely after the security experience gained in the aftermath of September 11th that basic principles can be legally set in stone as to what has to be done in order to protect civil aviation against acts of unlawful interference.</p>
<p class="contents">All Member States need to be singing from the same hymn sheet regarding common rules on security checks, searches, surveillance, prohibited items and security patrols, to name just a few.</p>
<p class="contents">I support the innovative approach taken by the Commission in proposing rules that will cover security measures during flights. However, I am less supportive of amendments put forward to this proposal which call for the compulsory use of armed in-flight security officers or ‘sky marshals’. I believe it is important that Member States are not legally bound to deploy or accept armed in-flight security officers on domestic or foreign aircraft. </p>

 This morning, Parliament voted for the Costa report on common rules in the field of civil aviation security. As the holiday season approaches, when millions of passengers get ready to board planes for their dream destinations – some 16 million per year from Brussels National Airport – I feel it is opportune to highlight certain crucial security rules on board aircraft. Whilst some people may grumble about having to observe stringent controls, I would say that this is the price that must be paid. The general flow may suffer, but ultimately this will be to everyone's benefit in security terms.</p>
<p class="contents">This report is a series of revisions of a 2002 law that was adopted in the aftermath of the attacks of 11 September 2001. All rhetoric about security should focus on the basic standards governing controls, surveillance, prohibited articles and security agents on board aircraft. There is one sole objective, namely greater consistency in the policies aimed at ‘one-stop security’ throughout the EU. </p>

 Mr President, with regard to the pattern of my voting on the resolutions on Tunisia, I should like to state that I voted through loyalty to my party. However, I believe we should not have two sets of weights and measures, in the sense that when voting on a number of resolutions over a short period of time that are directed against a particular country, perhaps one should either tone down the rate of resolutions and condemnation or use the same weights and balances as for other countries. </p>

 Regarding this motion for a resolution, our PPE-DE Group abstained, because it believes that the resolution was unnecessary, and that it does not treat Tunisia fairly.</p>
<p class="contents">I would like to remind you that this is the fourth time in the space of a few months that we are singling out Tunisia, whilst there are several other countries where the situation is much worse and about which we have said nothing. We thus abstained because whereas we agree that Tunisia still has a lot to do in order to improve its human rights record, we feel that the message we should be sending to this country needs to be constructive, and not in the form of a 'witch hunt'.</p>
<p class="contents">Of equal significance is the fact that whilst the resolution was passed, we had a majority in the room which either abstained or voted against. Thus, the effect of this resolution is certainly doubtful. </p>

 We support the joint motion for a resolution from the centre-left groups, in spite of the fact that it really is the Council of Europe and the European Court of Human Rights in Strasbourg that should monitor, both politically and legally, whether all the European states without exception comply with the UN Declaration on Human Rights. The Council of Europe and the European Court of Human Rights are the institutions that should be involved in these cases, especially, for example, with a view to ensuring that it is possible for Gay Pride’s democratic freedom to be upheld in Russia.</p>

 We strongly believe that environmental policy could present a significant economic opportunity for large-scale direct and indirect job creation, provided that innovation and industrial policies focus on promoting sustainable development. Accordingly, there needs to be a macroeconomic framework that supports each country’s sustainable development, strengthening employment, social cohesion and the environment.</p>
<p class="contents">The ongoing neoliberal policies, however, run counter to these objectives. The ‘Lisbon Strategy’ and the EU’s monetary and fiscal policies have had a detrimental impact on economic growth, employment and the environment.</p>
<p class="contents">We wish to draw attention to the fact that the EU still has high levels of unemployment, poverty, social exclusion and income inequality.

I welcome today's very positive vote and hope that its contents will not be forgotten when we come to look at our policies on growth in the future: the emphasis on quality and the decoupling of growth from resource use are very important points. I also welcome the willingness of the Austrian Presidency to listen to the points made in our deliberations in preparing this resolution.</p>
<p class="contents">They have made an historic step in their proposal to Council in taking up the need to develop a better training strategy, albeit only in certain sectors at present, to equip the construction sector, architects, etc. with the necessary skills to work in an environmentally positive way. This is something I have been urging the Commission to take on board for some time and I hope for a positive response.</p>
<p class="contents">We cannot meet our climate change targets if we do not have a workforce with the necessary skills to deliver. I also welcome the recognition that social cohesion is a necessary part of sustainable development: the poorest people often live and work in the worst environmental circumstances, whether in the EU or Africa. Our policies must deliver for everyone. </p>

 As well as being an ecological necessity, environmental protection is also an economic necessity. Great civilisations such as the Maya in Central America disappeared because they destroyed their natural resources.</p>
<p class="contents">In the 20th century, the most destructive system was communism, which not only killed tens of millions of human beings, but also laid waste to the environment. Examples of this include nuclear power stations on the basis of the Chernobyl model and the drying up of the Aral Sea. At the moment, the country that is polluting the world most is communist China.</p>
<p class="contents">In Europe, there are two prevailing ideologies in Brussels that are threatening the development of our countries. One is the doctrine of free trade, which is destroying our industrial fabric and which led to the Lisbon Strategy in 2000, and the other is Malthusianism, which has led on the one hand to the destruction of our vines and to our most fertile land being left fallow, and on the other to our demographic decline.</p>
<p class="contents">The replacement of missing children with calls for immigration and the relocation of our factories do not represent a solution. The real prerequisites for the genuinely sustainable development of our nations are the reinstatement of our borders and a major policy on the family. </p>

Mr President, I voted against the motion for a resolution because I felt that the attempt made to compare racism with homophobia was unacceptable.</p>
<p class="contents">There is no need to point out the horrors of racial discrimination, which is thought through long before it is actually carried out. It is right to condemn every act of mockery and violence towards people of different sexual orientations, but we certainly cannot regard the institutions’ and the Churches’ outlook as inhuman when they defend the family as a structure of great importance for the common good insofar as it is based on the distinction between the sexes and on the coming together of a man and a woman, that is to say, on heterosexuality.</p>
<p class="contents">This defence is laid down precisely by the human rights doctrine. Let us not forget Article 16 of the Universal Declaration on Human Rights – a document whose secular nature is by no means in doubt – which proclaims the nuclear family as the essence of society and the State, a unit which, as such, must be acknowledged and protected.</p>
<p class="contents">We must therefore not only stamp out racism and homophobia, but also reject a comparison of the two which, on closer inspection, constitutes an attempt to overturn a crucial aspect of human rights. </p>

 Mr President, since I already explained in yesterday’s debate why this motion for a resolution strikes me as silly and undemocratic, I need not labour this point any further, and I already concur in advance with all the bad things Mr Claeys is about to say on this subject. All I would like to add today is that there is also another, sizeable category of very real victims of very real racism which nobody seems to be bothered about and in respect of whom this institution never lays down any resolutions.</p>
<p class="contents">That is the category of very many native people who are no longer able to feel at home in their own street or their own town, and who become the victims of racist, anti-indigenous violence. Those are the older people and women who dare not go out after dark and who are terrorised on public transport. These people, however, are ignored by the politically correct, left-wing, fashionable opinion mafia, who – it is sad to say – monopolise the debates far too often in these institutions too. </p>

 Mr President, I voted in favour of the joint resolution by the other political groups. Unfortunately, the PPE-DE Group did not sign the joint resolution as a group. However, as individuals, many colleagues voted in favour of it.</p>
<p class="contents">I think that fighting discrimination in all forms is a very important part of the work of an MEP. Even though the joint resolution had some ambiguities and was not 100% perfect, I can support it, based on the fact that it was reasonably balanced for this House. </p>

Mr President, I merely wish to say that I share Mrs Kauppi’s position exactly.</p>
<p class="contents">As far as I was concerned, this was a motion for a resolution against racism, xenophobia, anti-Semitism and homophobia. I voted in favour because I feel it is an extremely important motion for a resolution. Last time, we had a joint motion for a resolution against homophobia on which all of the groups were in agreement. Unfortunately, I feel that the groundwork has not been properly prepared this time. Perhaps next time we will be able to achieve unanimity against homophobia in this Chamber. </p>

 Mr President, I too voted against the motion for a resolution in this instance. Allow me to say a few words on it. Although xenophobia and discrimination are shameful things, I consider this to be a rather modish motion, of the kind that passes through our Chamber relatively often in various forms. I voted against it also because I do not think that in such a document there should be direct references to individual Member States and their governments or that they should be exhorted to follow different approaches, since everything rests in the hands of the voters who elected these governments. We should not be handing out marks to them.</p>
<p class="contents">Paragraph 2 is clearly a list of very shameful acts, but I do not think that they represent a dominant current of opinion in Europe, and this was another reason why I voted against the motion. In paragraphs 4 and 5 I feel it is not appropriate, I repeat again, for the European Parliament to be involving itself, to my mind somewhat improperly, in the internal affairs of sovereign states such as Poland or Russia. In paragraph 11 there is again an explicit reference to Poland, and for this reason too I opposed the motion. </p>

 Mr President, I have voted against the motion for a resolution on racist and homophobic violence because I find it unacceptable that a goal that is legitimate in itself should be contaminated by party-political considerations. There is, for example, recital E, where political parties are criticised for raising the failure of the multicultural model as an issue and for espousing the protection of national identities in Europe.</p>
<p class="contents">Paragraph 11 is inspired by the inability of the Left to accept that right-wing parties win democratic elections and form governments. Paragraph 12, on the other hand, wants to generalise the typically Belgian system whereby parties are robbed of their funding when they denounce failing immigration policy. That is a threat to the right to the free expression of opinion, as is, in fact, recital K that aims to introduce censorship on the Internet.</p>
<p class="contents">Nearly all the groups who tabled this motion for a resolution back Turkey’s accession to the European Union. They might want to take a look at what the situation is like over there when it comes to discrimination against minorities and homophobia. </p>

Mr President, I too would like to take this opportunity to explain why I voted against this motion for a resolution against racist and homophobic violence. No sensible human being believes in racist or homophobic violence and everyone will condemn it wherever it actually exists. However, it seems to me that in this motion for a resolution, individuals who stand up for their own culture and national identity are all too quickly and easily suspected of racism. It also appears to me that individuals who stand up for the traditionally Christian, European image of the family are all too quickly suspected of possibly even welcoming homophobic violence. In my opinion, it is absolutely inadmissible when this is also then to be pinned onto individual EU Member States. </p>

Racist violence, alas, is now prevalent throughout Europe and must be vigorously addressed. I regret though that the resolution on this important subject was misused as a vehicle to attack internal government composition in Member States, which is the product of the democratic process and, frankly, beyond the remit of the European Parliament. Such drove me to vote against the resolution. In terms of the standards and ethics expected of democratic parties I very much regret that in Northern Ireland the Ulster Unionist Party has seen fit to invite into its Stormont Assembly Party the political representative of the UVF, an illegal organisation which has been mired in racist, sectarian and other violence. Such shameful association not only diminishes those who so taint themselves but undermines what should be a united stand by all democratic parties against criminality, whether of the racist or any other variety. </p>

 I did not vote in favour of the motion for a resolution against racism and homophobia, even though I warmly welcome the thrust of its content and I consider it politically timely.</p>
<p class="contents">My objections – I abstained – revolve solely around the reference to a ‘case’ in Portugal, which is purportedly indicative of a serious culture of homophobia in Portugal.</p>
<p class="contents">The Gisberta case, which took place in Oporto, was simply an act of juvenile delinquency, and was judged that way by Portuguese society. It was also properly dealt with by the legal authorities.</p>
<p class="contents">There is therefore no reason whatsoever to include this case in such an important motion for a resolution, on an issue of such importance. </p>

 The EU is founded on a community based on the indivisible and universal values of human dignity, freedom, equality and solidarity. By coming together, the 25 Member States decided to uphold and to promote these values.</p>
<p class="contents">The numerous racist, xenophobic, anti-Semitic and homophobic attacks that have taken place in recent times in Europe are therefore unacceptable and intolerable. It is crucial to condemn them publicly.</p>
<p class="contents">This is why I drew up a resolution on behalf of my political group. In it, I have invited the EU institutions, the Member States and all the democratic political parties in Europe to condemn all acts of intolerance and incitement to hatred.</p>
<p class="contents">We must remain vigilant, but must not lump everything together by listing examples of individual attacks perpetrated in Member States fighting against racism and homophobia with extreme positions openly adopted by some governments. What is more, the list of tragic examples contained in the joint resolution tabled by the Group of the Greens/European Free Alliance, the Group of the Alliance of Liberals and Democrats for Europe, the Socialist Group in the European Parliament and the Confederal Group of the European United Left/Nordic Green Left is not an exhaustive one.</p>

I therefore voted for the motion for a resolution tabled by the Group of the European People’s Party (Christian Democrats) and European Democrats and for the joint motion for a resolution tabled by the other groups. </p>

Homophobia and racism have no place in Europe. Article 13 of the Treaty establishing the European Community prohibits any discrimination based on sex, racial or ethnic origin, religion or belief, disability, age or sexual orientation.</p>
<p class="contents">Particularly following the scandalous and distressing events in Moscow which took place on the fringes of the Gay Pride rally in May 2006, it is imperative that we send a strong signal regarding tolerance in Europe. Last Saturday in Warsaw at the equality parade, I demonstrated against the increasing homophobic tendencies that are particularly prevalent in Poland, which is an EU Member State. The right of European citizens to sexual self-determination is a human right which is defended by us social democrats here in Parliament, whether in Warsaw, Riga or Frankfurt. I therefore voted for the motion for a resolution. </p>

 It was a mistake to mix racism and homophobia in the same text.</p>
<p class="contents">There are paragraphs in this motion for a resolution that I cannot support, such as the one carrying accusations of police violence, and I reiterate my total opposition to homosexual adoption.</p>
<p class="contents">It would be impossible to object to a text that vehemently condemns known acts of racism in Europe.</p>

I voted in favour of the resolution. Within the European Union, blatant racism is still widespread, and no group suffers more than the Roma. There have been many reported cases of verbal, emotional and physical attacks on the Roma, including several committed by police forces. Although this resolution fails to make sufficient mention of the Roma issue in particular, it is essential that Parliament work to conquer racism in all areas of Europe. </p>

 I and my British Conservative colleagues abhor any actions by individuals, governments or political parties to incite racism, anti-Semitism and homophobia. Any person or organisation perpetrating or inciting such discrimination should be subject to the full force of the law. We believe in liberty and the rights of individuals to live their lives free from fear of persecution and prejudice.</p>
<p class="contents">However, we were unable to support the joint motion for a resolution because it undermines the cause of tolerance by arbitrarily listing specific incidents and specific events and organisations. The motivation for the motion appears to be unnecessarily confrontational, rather than a genuine attempt to promote the cause of tolerance and non-discrimination. Consequently, we have abstained on the final vote. </p>

We in the Group of the European People’s Party (Christian Democrats) and European Democrats condemn racially motivated attacks, assaults and discrimination in every shape and form and firmly repudiate racist tendencies; that was stated in the motion for a resolution on homophobia that was adopted in January, and we have also spelled it out in our latest draft motion for a resolution. We call on the EU institution, the Member States and all political parties in the EU to do likewise.</p>
<p class="contents">The joint motion for a resolution tabled by the Socialist Group in the European Parliament, the Group of the Greens/European Free Alliance and the Group of the Alliance of Liberals and Democrats for Europe is not a document we can endorse, on the grounds that it arbitrarily pillories individual Member States and puts a motion for a resolution – a parliamentary instrument – in the service of false statements and insinuations.</p>
<p class="contents">To name but two of these:</p>
<p class="contents">Paragraph 2 includes reference to: “the brutal assault on a German citizen of Ethiopian origin ... in particular because of its racial motive.” The German Attorney-General, whose remit includes major crimes jeopardising the peace within Germany, sent this case back to the relevant court on the grounds that it was not primarily racially motivated.</p>
<p class="contents">The draft motion for a resolution contains generalised presuppositions concerning the Member States’ police forces: ... “Member States should consider whether their police forces and judicial systems suffer from ‘institutional racism’....” These people put their lives and limbs at risk, day in and day out, for the safety of all of us, and I refuse to lump them all together in this way and denounce them as racists. </p>

In considering the issues raised in this report it is necessary to make clear that whilst I am opposed to intolerance I do think that the criticism of the new Polish Government is counterproductive and that it is up to the Poles to democratically resolve these issues. In addition it must be understood that Poland is a profoundly Catholic country and the people as a result will reflect their Catholic beliefs in exactly the same manner as Muslims reflect the Islamic view on homosexuality. It is rare that Parliament, if indeed ever, criticises Muslims for holding such views and it only reflects double standards if Catholics are to be treated differently. </p>

I welcome this resolution and was proud to vote for it. Yesterday's debate clearly illustrated how far we have still to go in establishing equality of respect within the EU. Many people have expressed their concern at the homophobic feelings voiced in Parliament’s Chamber. Fortunately, the vast majority of this House rejected these statements and has given a strong voice to criticism of at least two Member States and to racist acts in others. This is a welcome step. Politicians have a crucial role in establishing a climate that rejects violence and hate speech: it is part of establishing an inclusive society. As we are confronting politicians who promote prejudice, we must also do the same when this is done by the media and our institutions. We must face up to the human rights abuses in the EU. This positive vote today is part of that process. </p>

 The Austrian People’s Party delegation, like the Group of the European People’s Party (Christian Democrats) and European Democrats, has, in all the resolutions on the subject both this year and in former years, taken a stand against racially motivated violence and xenophobia, as also against discrimination against homosexuals, and in favour of the highest standards in human rights and the outlawing of discrimination. It, too, therefore, has endorsed the motion for a resolution tabled by Mr Gaubert on behalf of the PPE-DE Group.</p>
<p class="contents">The ÖVP delegation has also, however, voted against the GUE/NGL, ALDE, Verts/ALE and PSE’s joint motion for a resolution on the grounds that these political groupings made no attempt to join with the PPE-DE group in fashioning a common text; another consideration is that there has been an inflation in this sort of motion for a resolution, and that this example of the genre is a purely political document characterized by many mistakes and generalizations, doing no more than using the themes of racism and intolerance as a pretext for sending out ideological messages. </p>

 All forms of human violence must be condemned. The inalienable right to life, freedom and security and respect for people’s dignity apply to every human being. National laws underpin these rights.</p>
<p class="contents">To mix discourse on homosexual people and on racism discredits the promotion of human rights. Punishing all violations of these rights is the responsibility of each Member State and falls within the scope of the Council of Europe’s European Convention on Human Rights, which all Member States have signed. As such they are responsible to the European Court of Human Rights in Strasbourg.</p>
<p class="contents">Is it the case that a new form of totalitarianism, which runs counter to democratically elected governments, is in the process of emerging? Extremism is on the rise on both left and right, as the established parties merge with one another and accordingly lack the credibility and the political vision that is acceptable to families in the Member States. To reject the kind of manipulation and disinformation that is being peddled in this resolution is to fight against the emergence of extremism and violence, and to refuse to fan the flames of hate against the sections of society to which this resolution relates.</p>
<p class="contents">This is why my group decided not to support the motion for a resolution. </p>

 We are in favour of technological and digital solutions that will help to improve train signalling and protection, with a view to enhancing safety and eliminating traffic congestion on the rail network.</p>
<p class="contents">Safety is particularly important in light of the substantial increase in the speed and capacity of railway lines.</p>
<p class="contents">We have our doubts, however, as to whether the proposed system, ERTMS, is actually better than existing national systems. What it does deliver is greater cross-border interoperability, although it should be remembered that this proposal also forms part of the strategy of liberalising rail transport and of the internal market concept.</p>
<p class="contents">The key question is how the additional costs of the new system for the rail companies will be funded. Who will bear these costs and how will the burden be spread among the Member States at a time of restricted Community budget?</p>
<p class="contents">The same thing has happened with the trans-European networks and the European programmes for transport policy, which have seen their funding reduced in the forthcoming financial framework.</p>
<p class="contents">We also have our doubts about the condition that the Structural Funds for transport must be used solely for implementing this system.</p>

 We regret the fact that, even though they had the backing of 200 Members, some of the proposals that we tabled were rejected, which were as follows:</p>
<p class="contents">-	to set up a Community programme for traditional, small-scale inshore fishing;</p>
<p class="contents">-	to establish emergency transitional compensation to offset the effects of the increase in the price of fuel.</p>
<p class="contents">Other proposals, however, were adopted and included in the original report, as confirmed today. Of these I should like to highlight:</p>
<p class="contents">-	to recognise the specific nature of inshore and traditional fishing in the CFP, and to determine how far the existing instruments are suitable for responding to the sector's needs;</p>
<p class="contents">-	the new EFP must continue the financing of fleet renewal measures for inshore</p>
<p class="contents">fisheries;</p>
<p class="contents">-	to set up education and training programmes aimed at encouraging young people to enter the sector;</p>

 The report on inshore fishing is an excellent one, as it succeeds in identifying the problems facing fishermen involved in this kind of fishing and puts forward realistic and effective solutions.</p>
<p class="contents">If we do not want fishing to disappear as so many other economic sectors have done before it, it is high time for us to take certain measures, such as strengthening the fisheries sector by setting up an inter-branch organisation to promote and develop fishery products from landing to direct sale, including a special heading for 'inshore fishing' in the future European Fisheries Fund, and increasing checks and sanctions in order to avoid unfair competition from third-country vessels that have lower costs and do not comply with the same safety standards.</p>
<p class="contents">Paradoxically, consumption of fish is on the increase throughout the European Union, so now is not the time to drop our guard, particularly in view of the fact that inshore fishing is a very environmentally friendly job that consumes very little energy and supplies an important product.</p>
<p class="contents">It must be aided and supported as a matter of priority, so as to restore its economic balance and protect maritime jobs. </p>

 The EU is at present giving too much money to large fishing operators and vessels. This should be redistributed for the benefit of small-scale fisheries. I am therefore voting in favour of Amendments 7 and 9. This investment in small-scale fisheries should be made within the existing budget framework. Under no circumstances do I want proposed measures to lead to an increase in the budget. </p>

Mr President, Commissioners, ladies and gentlemen, an agreement has been reached in a meeting of the Wine Management Committee to amend Regulations (EC) No 1622/2000, No 884/2001 and No 753/2002, with the aim of authorising the use of wood shavings to age wine.</p>
<p class="contents">I wanted to table an oral question, with the support of more than 40 fellow Members, whom I should to thank, on the admissibility of this oenological practice, because I believe that Parliament must be able to express its opinion on an issue that is only outwardly technical but which actually raises some important issues relating to the quality and future of European wine.</p>
<p class="contents">There was an attempt to justify this proposal by the need for us to fall in line with those non-European countries that already authorise this practice. I wonder, instead, whether the specific nature of European wine and its strength on the world market do not indeed lie in high quality and respect for traditional practices. Has the Commission assessed the impacts of this proposal on high-quality wines? What measures does it plan to adopt in order to ban this practice, at least for high-quality wines? As regards labelling, does the Commission regard the failure to mention this practice on labels as being compatible with our guidelines on transparency? Finally, what would happen during WTO negotiations if, instead of trying to raise standards relating to oenological practices, we lowered them?</p>
<p class="contents">I should be grateful to the Commission if it would kindly shed some light on these points, not least in view of the next WTO reform of the wine sector. </p>

Mr President, Commissioner, ladies and gentlemen, this is an historic moment for our European wine sector. The opening up of the world's agricultural markets and ever increasing international competition have called into question our wine production and marketing systems and have forced our producers to become more flexible.</p>
<p class="contents">The use of ‘modern’ oenological practices in many third countries and the less rigorous application of the 'wholly obtained' rule worldwide are excluding our products from our very own market, a market that, on its own, represents two-thirds of global trade in wine. If it is therefore truly essential to review the stringency of our rules and if this global challenge really requires us to be more flexible, then it becomes crucial to set limits and conditions for using these new oenological practices. It becomes crucial to balance this increased flexibility with the requirements of tradition, quality and consumer protection. This opening-up must serve to preserve and enhance the strengths of our wine sector and to give it new impetus, and definitely not to curb high-quality production to the advantage of wines with fabricated organoleptic qualities.</p>
<p class="contents">The Commission wants to justify the proposal under debate today by the need to avoid the risk of confusion for the consumer and to prevent a distortion of competition among producers. Commissioner, if this is really the desired purpose and if this is truly the intended aim, then I am sorry to have to tell you that we have a major failure on our hands.</p>
<p class="contents">Genuine consumer protection and a genuine desire to prevent any distortions of competition should have led to a compulsory provision, that is to say, it should have been made compulsory for the use of wood shavings to be indicated on the labels. Any other provision is and will remain completely ineffective when it comes to protecting the consumer and even more ineffective when it comes to preventing distortions of competition.</p>
<p class="contents">Only a clear label corresponding to the product’s content will ensure that the information is transparent. Only in that way will the consumer be in a position to know exactly what he or she is buying. Only in that way will his or her freedom of choice be safeguarded, together with that of the wine grower.</p>
<p class="contents">Not providing for this kind of information on labels means destroying part of Europe's wine sector in the near future, a sector founded on tradition, on diversification and regional character and on a real culture of wine as an expression of our lands.</p>
<p class="contents">European wine growers will have no choice in the matter. Sooner or later they will be forced to abandon their traditional practices because their products will, for no apparent reason, prove too expensive in the eyes of a consumer lacking proper, clear information.</p>
<p class="contents">Commissioner, is this the Community’s policy on protecting consumers? Is this the Community’s policy on transparency and labelling? Is this that promotion of the quality of agricultural products about which we talk so much? I would be grateful if you would kindly respond to Parliament as a matter of urgency. </p>

 Mr President, ladies and gentlemen, I will answer the two questions on the use of wood shavings in wine production at the same time.</p>
<p class="contents">The aim of the proposal for a regulation of the Commission, which is being reviewed by the Wine Management Committee, is to set out the conditions for using oak shavings in the production of wine. The Council ruled on this new wine-making process in Regulation (EC) 2165/2005 of 20 December 2005. The Commission feels that the provisions for wine labelling set out in the proposal would fulfil the requirements for transparency for consumers as well as the product quality requirements. The proposal sets out rules for labelling wines, the aim of which is to prevent consumers from being misled. It also retains the option of stating ‘oak barrel’ or ‘oak barrique’ on wine which has been aged or matured in wooden vessels, and which has never come into contact with oak shavings. Under these conditions, it is not possible for wines which have been aged in contact with oak shavings and which display the taste that comes from maturing wine in contact with wood to be mistaken for wines matured by the traditional method in barriques, and so there is no need to state any special information in the case of such wines.</p>
<p class="contents">Under Regulation (EC) No 1493/1999 on the common organisation of the market in wine, Member States may stipulate stricter conditions for wine-making processes in respect of fine wines originating from specified growing areas and for table wine with a geographical marking, in order to ensure the preservation of the essential characteristic features of these fine wines. The Commission cannot interfere with these domestic powers. This process has now been approved for producers in the Union by the Council. The International Organisation of Vine and Wine permitted it some years ago. The Commission feels that the traditional methods of maturing in barriques will be preserved for producers of high quality wines, as is the case in third countries which permitted this process years ago.</p>
<p class="contents">Long-term use in other wine-producing countries and numerous experiments carried out under EU control show that the process does not have a negative effect on the health of consumers. The Commission is of the opinion that greater flexibility in permitting new wine-making processes will enable producers in the Community to increase their market and to reach more consumers, especially through exports, and also to enhance the competitiveness of the wine sector vis-à-vis third countries. </p>

Mr President, ladies and gentlemen, as we have heard, current European legislation does not permit European producers to use wood shavings to age wine.</p>
<p class="contents">However, the legislation of other wine-producing countries, in particular the United States, Chile and South Africa, does not provide for such a ban. Moreover, on the basis of a recent agreement with the European Union, these countries can export their own wines into the European Union’s internal market without the labelling on the bottles making any reference to the use of wood shavings.</p>
<p class="contents">The Italian wine industry is thus falling victim to unfair competition. Until now, it has relied on its diversity, on its ancient vines, and on the quality and wholesomeness of its product. Now, the image of a reliable and credible market, which the Italian market is regarded as being, will be undermined.</p>
<p class="contents">Globalisation is inevitably affecting a sector, too, for which we are the envy of the world. We will certainly not succeed in stopping it, but we need appropriate guarantees. We are not talking about opposing the entry into the European market of this system of ageing, but we are demanding protection of the right of consumers to know what they are buying and what they are drinking, to know what kind of quality they are getting for a particular price. Italian and European producers do not need to use tricks or to cut corners in order to sell their products, the high quality of which is recognised worldwide.</p>
<p class="contents">The Wine Management Committee is preparing to approve an amendment to the current standards relating to oenological practices, with a view to authorising the use of wood shavings to age wine, instead of the traditional practice of ageing it in barrels. Twenty years ago, the scandal caused by the use of methanol in wine production served as a warning to us. Only a production process that is carried out seriously and professionally can last the course in the market. There is truth in the adage <span class="italic">in vino veritas, </span>
but for once let us leave it to the labels to reveal the information we are entitled to. </p>

Mr President, Commissioner, I think that your views on oenological practices and the use of wood shavings are very general and that the Commission has not perhaps understood the basic problem raised by their use. I shall summarise it for you:</p>
<p class="contents">You said that the International Organisation of Vine and Wine allows these oenological practices. Have you been told, Commissioner, that international practices must without fail coincide with European practices and that we, as Europeans, are obliged to accept these oenological practices of new countries which undermine the European market? Have you been told, Commissioner, that the Commission can go to the WTO negotiations without safeguarding products of geographical indication, which include wine? Have you been told, Commissioner, by society, by viniculturalists, by oenologists, by the European Parliament, that you can create unfair competition on the European market? Obviously the message you read is very, very general and obviously I agree with my fellow members that the last step taken is to write the new practice on the bottle labels, in order to protect consumers. But who is protecting European wine? No one in this Chamber assumes that European wine must be the same as that produced 100 years ago. No one in this Chamber assumes that it must not be modernised and no one in this Chamber, knowing the new review of the COM in wine, will refrain from making innovative proposals. However, what worries us is that this simple, unopposed use of wood shavings, which you said can purely and simply liberalise or increase the competitiveness of poor quality commercial wine, may cause a fall in the price on the commercial market of good quality wines, of wines with protected names, of wines with geographical indications, of wines which no one in the global trade can undermine and you are opening a back door so that good quality European wines can be undermined cheaply.</p>
<p class="contents">I shall not take up too much of your time, Commissioner, because we shall discuss this with the Commissioner in about a month's time and in the Committee on Agriculture and Rural Development next week. However, I would like to ask one thing of you, on behalf of all my honourable friends in this House: fragmentary, dumbing-down practices for the future of wine and the development of the common agricultural policy should be avoided.

 Mr President, Commissioner, in six months, or in a year at most, we will have a reorganised wine market, and I would therefore like to examine our current topic in the light of the general developments that have taken place over the last few years and that will continue over the years to come.</p>
<p class="contents">First of all, I would emphasise – and in this I am practically diametrically opposed to the previous speaker – that, when it comes to wine, the real decisions are made by the consumer. We are not forced to drink wine, and we are under no obligation to choose any particular type of wine: it is ultimately up to the consumer to decide.</p>
<p class="contents">So, what has the consumer done over the past few years? We have witnessed a fall in the consumption of table wines and an increase in the consumption of quality wines. We have also seen a considerable increase in the number of consumers and, if you have read the press recently regarding the decisions and wishes of China, you will be aware that, within the next ten years, we will have millions of new wine drinkers in the world.</p>
<p class="contents">In addition, we have seen, again at global level and particularly from the new vineyards in the New World, the appearance of new flavours that match the consumers' requirements. All of that has happened over the same period of just 20 years, whilst consumers in France have halved their consumption of wine.</p>
<p class="contents">It is therefore clear that there have been many major developments regarding wine consumption. Europe needs to be well positioned in this global market. I think we are all agreed that we need to act to preserve the globally-acknowledged high quality of our major wines from Spain, Italy and France – and I myself come from Champagne – in order to protect both their quality and their brand image throughout the world. At the same time, however, European viticulture needs to adapt to the needs of consumers all over the world.</p>
<p class="contents">That, ladies and gentlemen, is why, in view of the changing tastes of our consumers, and given the disappearance of certain consumers and the appearance of others, I think it is quite natural to have the option of using these oak chippings in the production of European wine, provided, of course, that this option is not an obligation, that it is exercised within the framework of our various regulations and, finally, that all Member States may impose restrictive conditions on their use.</p>
<p class="contents">In conclusion, let us not forget that, on our continent, in our 25 Member States, several million jobs, perhaps five million, depend on the production of wine, and that the sector has a turnover of EUR 17 billion – almost exactly the same as the wheat sector and significantly greater than the sugar sector, which is four times smaller. For all of these reasons, we need to adapt to the demands of our consumers. </p>

 Mr President, in the wine trade I would be described as an <span class="italic">amateur du vin</span>
. In layman’s terms, that means I can tell my claret from my hock. Indeed, I have taken exams under the UK’s Wine and Spirit Education Trust scheme and have reached the level just below Master of Wine, so perhaps I speak with a little authority here.</p>
<p class="contents">The British market is unusual inside the EU in that it has been growing at a dramatic rate for many years. However, we are eschewing wines from the EU in favour of wines from around the world, in particular Australia and California. Why should this be, you ask? Could it simply be that they make wine that suits the customer’s palate? Producers in these and other New World countries are not bound by pettifogging bureaucracy that tells them which grapes to grow where and then how to make the wines. They produce unsubsidised wines that people want to buy, at a price they can afford.</p>
<p class="contents">But there is another factor in play and that is product information. Consider this situation: you are in a supermarket looking at hundreds of bottles of wine. You pick up a bottle – like this elegant Pomerol, for example – and try to find out something about it. Not everybody carries Sotheby’s Wine Encyclopaedia around with them. Why should they? They look to the bottle for information. The Pomerol is sadly lacking in information. However, this bottle of wine from California tells you more about wine on a label three inches square – that is 10 cm – than most people will ever need to know, including the fact that it was matured in American oak for 12 months.</p>
<p class="contents">Gaining and keeping customers is what business is all about. Creating more rules for EU producers to abide by will cripple them and their industry and no amount of subsidy will save them. </p>

Mr President, at this time when the Commission has to put the finishing touches to its reform of the COM in wine, the debate being held in Parliament today is closely related to the competitiveness of European viticulture compared to that of third countries. The Commission says that it wants its reform to promote this competitiveness.</p>
<p class="contents">The use of oak shavings in the production of wines is a practice permitted by the International Organisation of Vine and Wine (OIV). The conditions for use of this practice are nevertheless awaiting approval by the Wine Management Committee. There is so little protection for the wine sector these days that it has become necessary to reconcile the preservation of traditional practices, such as ageing in barrels, with the possibility for European wine-growers, should they decide to do so, to compete under equal conditions with third-country producers, all while offering maximum guarantees of transparency and information for the consumer, of course.</p>
<p class="contents">In our view, this practice should be applied to wines subject to ageing or carrying traditional mentions such as 'Crianza', 'Reserva' or 'Gran Reserva'. The label is there precisely to prevent confusion amongst consumers, clearly indicating whether such a practice has been carried out or not, for example by reserving the term ‘oak’ for traditional ageing in barrels.</p>
<p class="contents">Furthermore, the basic Regulation for this COM allows Member States, in relation to wine-making practices and treatments, to impose stricter national conditions in order to ensure that the characteristics of their quality wines are maintained. In the case of my country, the Supervisory Councils are the main guardians of the quality of Spanish wines.</p>
<p class="contents">At the moment, however, the Commission is responsible for establishing the conditions for use of this practice at Community level. We would therefore ask you to do so with the necessary transparency, in order to prevent any confusion for the consumer and to guarantee that the same measures are applied to imports from third countries.</p>
<p class="contents">We would also like the Commission to explain to us why it is fragmenting the debate on wine-making practices, when they should be dealt with jointly. Furthermore, in autumn 2005, document COM(2005) 395 was communicated to us with a series of technical amendments to the basic Regulation: replacement of the distillation of sub-products of wine production by its withdrawal in Slovenia and Slovakia, modification of the classification of cultivated areas in Poland or new mentions for labelling.</p>
<p class="contents">These amendments did not include the addition of oak shavings, however. I do not believe that this is a translation problem, since neither the French version nor the Spanish version introduced such a change. If that had been the case, the Commission on Agriculture and Rural Development may not have chosen to deal with this issue by means of the simplified procedure.</p>
<p class="contents">Can the Commission tell us, therefore, when it decided to introduce this new element and why it has not waited for the reform of the COM in order to do so. </p>

 Mr President, Commissioner, ladies and gentlemen, like some of my fellow Members, I signed this oral question on the use of wood chippings as an œnological practice for European wines. I signed it because I wonder whether, and hope that, guarantees can be given to ensure that the quality wines we are producing in Europe are and continue to be recognised as quality wines.</p>
<p class="contents">It would not shock me at all if this practice were to be recognised and authorised. The wine production sector has been waiting for this recognition because it will allow some producers to meet the expectations of international consumers. Furthermore, there will be no compulsory expansion of this practice: the Member States will still be free to lay down restrictive legislation for quality wines produced in specified areas.</p>
<p class="contents">Nevertheless, I think we need both guarantees regarding the provision of information on wines that have undergone this practice and also quality guarantees. I would like to emphasise that the recognition of this practice, which has been imported from countries outside the European Union, does not legitimise other practices that do not seem to provide the necessary quality guarantees both in terms of health and in terms of identity. Wine is a very particular product that conveys an identity and a whole way of life, so let us not move too rapidly towards the practice of 'patchwork' wines.</p>
<p class="contents">Finally, I would like to take advantage of this debate to lay the emphasis on the forthcoming Common Market Organisation (CMO) review, which should give European viticulture a real solution for the future. European wine producers need to get the benefit from the worldwide growth in the wine market, and this needs to be ensured through a redistribution of the financial aid from the CMO. The decoupling of aid could be the solution that will enable us to give greater responsibility to those active in the sector, with the benefit that all the wine produced will have outlets on the consumer market. We need to re-examine the distillation conditions – for potable alcohol and crisis distillation – as part of a system based on a degressive guide price over the course of the campaign. Equally, we need to encourage the use of vine-based products to enrich wines, for example using grape must instead of sugar.</p>
<p class="contents">In order to ensure that European wines retain their position as world leaders, the European Union must use the new CMO to construct a policy for promotion, marketing, research and development and training, and it also needs to establish an economic observatory. There is absolutely no doubt that we need to reform the restructuring, planting and grubbing up systems in order to respond to the needs of the market over the medium to long term, but we also need to preserve the surface area of vineyards – in other words, we need to preserve the European Union's wine-growing potential.</p>
<p class="contents">It is quite inconceivable for European vineyards to disappear from our landscapes, from our history and from our rural and cultural heritage, which has been shaped over so many years by wine producers on land uniquely suited to growing grapes. What will become of this land and of those who live off it, those who have worked to improve their art for the great pleasure of consumers, or perhaps I could say gourmets. </p>

 Mr President, Commissioner, ladies and gentlemen, although wine is a product originating from specific regions, it is bought and sold throughout the world, and it is for that reason that an international framework is required to lay down oenological practices and ensure international competitiveness. We all know about the special way of enriching wines in Barriques; it is an old tradition, but one justified by the fact that storage in wooden barrels has a positive effect on the wine’s maturation process.</p>
<p class="contents">However, the techniques used for storing wine are not static. As we strive to use the best practices in developing wines in line with consumers’ expectations, new knowledge and new possibilities become available to us, and these are being used in countries outside the European Union.</p>
<p class="contents">It is at this point that I ask myself the question as to how we value tradition on the one hand and modern practices on the other. None of us would want, in this day and age, to still be travelling around by horse and cart. I do not think that the one should exclude the other, but we are losing our certainties. Mr Castiglione’s question about the practical legal aspects of allowing the use of wood chips and of labelling is the right one to ask.</p>
<p class="contents">I think we need to take care that our wine labels do not end up being turned into the sort of leaflets that we get with medicines. What consumers want is bottles that look nice, with the most important information clearly visible. The labelling issue is a tricky one, one that I think is best dealt with at the national or regional level, as it should be. It cannot be the European Union’s function to regulate everything right down to the tiniest detail, or we will end up with the sort of thing with which we are familiar in the context of the labelling of allergenic substances, with demands being made for labelling in every conceivable language.</p>
<p class="contents">It must also be clear to us that it is not possible to monitor what is done with barriques or wood chips. Where its maturation in barriques or with the addition of wood chips is concerned, wine is a regional product, and the question of objections on health grounds does not arise here. Wine has been matured in wood for many generations, and its effects on health are still not a matter of dispute. </p>

 Mr President, the wine sector in the European Union is a very important source of jobs and income, which are concentrated in small- and medium-sized family-run vineyards that therefore play a vital role in the development of rural areas.</p>
<p class="contents">In the European wine sector, we are witnessing a crisis affecting several European regions, as a result of the gradual dropping off of demand. The task of the European authorities, in terms of wine policy, should be based on the need to improve and promote the agricultural quality of traditional production, and on the need to protect that production against the increasing competition from third countries.</p>
<p class="contents">All too often, poor labelling policy is the main cause of the loss of market share for traditional producers. In order to prevent unfair competition in the wine market, with its disastrous consequences for our producers, it is vital for us to protect consumers by means of labelling regulations based on transparent information regarding the characteristics of the products, the techniques used, the original features and the methods of maturing the wine.</p>
<p class="contents">The average consumer, in other words the man in the street, sees wine production as a process of maturation in oak barrels, which is why we need to prevent the risk of confusion and deception for the consumer with regard to the quality of the wine and how it was matured. To this end, we need to ensure that consumers are provided with the appropriate information to give them freedom of choice. It is therefore vital for it to be compulsory to state on the label that oak chippings have been used in the process of maturing the wine.</p>

 Mr President, Commissioner, ladies and gentlemen, you will perhaps be surprised that, as chairman of this Parliament's intergroup on 'wine, quality and tradition', I have not taken advantage of this opportunity to ask my own oral question on the use of oak chippings in wine making.</p>
<p class="contents">In view of the fact that, in the next few days, we will be debating a Commission communication on reforming the common organisation of the market in wine, I think that we need to avoid putting the cart before the horse, and that it takes time to reform legislation that is this sensitive and that so starkly divides European wine producers.</p>
<p class="contents">Some of them tell us that they have been waiting for 10 years to be allowed to implement this practice of using wood chippings, while others see it as an attack on the traditions of European wine production and fear that there is a risk of consumers being deceived on a grand scale. Yet others remind us of the responsibility of the Member States, in particular regarding legislation on quality wines produced in a specified region. Finally, we must not forget the responsibilities of the International Organisation of Vine and Wine (OIV), which extends beyond the Community framework.</p>
<p class="contents">As always, the devil is in the details, and we cannot deal with those details now in this forum, so I would like to take this opportunity to warn the Commission against an unseemly headlong rush that would bring with it many dangers. First of all, there is the danger of presenting people with a <span class="italic">fait accompli</span>
 by adopting, in comitology, a regulation on an œnological practice that should be defined when we carry out the reform of the CMO for wine. Then there is the danger of creating an uncontrollable bureaucratic monster, with the associated risks of deception and distortions of competition.</p>
<p class="contents">I would therefore strongly urge the Commission to avoid adopting the draft regulation amending Regulations No 1622/2000, No 884/2001 and No 753/2002, which, as far as I know, has not been adopted. With regard to labelling, I would warn against creating a precedent that could have an unfortunate effect on the labelling of alcoholic drinks. So far, we have been able to avoid having labels that harm the product and end up being illegible for the consumer, so we must avoid playing with fire in this sensitive area that Mrs Klaß has described so well. </p>

 Mr President, in contrast to those who have brought in this motion, I have no fundamental objections to the Commission's decision, by which it has legalised a practice to which reference is made in, for example, the US-EU wine trade accord and in individual concessions accorded to third countries since 1984. This motion has been drafted at the behest of the Italian Government, and it is for that reason that I wonder why it is that two Italian Members belonging to different groups have tabled it. The Commission’s decision also benefits consumers, since the ‘barrique’ practice of maturing wine in wooden casks is traditional with white wine, but particularly so with red. A wooden cask of this sort, made of oak and capable of containing 250 litres, costs between EUR 600 and EUR 800. It can be used three times at most, so that red wine is at least a euro per litre more expensive if matured in a barrique than if wooden planks – to which there can be no objection on the grounds of consumer or health policy – are used.</p>
<p class="contents">It is in this way that this decision benefits consumers, who can buy high-quality wine at lower prices, and so my view of this is diametrically opposed to that of the motion’s authors. To Mrs Batzeli, who said that the low-cost production of quality wines of this sort should not be allowed, I ask where we will end up if we in this House try to prohibit technological progress. Of course this discussion needs to relate to the organisation of the wine market, but the fact that Italy asked for it put the Commission under pressure to act, and so I can give Commissioner Špidla my unreserved support. From the consumer’s point of view, there is no problem. We will have to give some thought to whether we should allow – ‘allow’, mark you, rather than ‘prescribe’ – positive labelling, in the sense that someone could, as an advertising tactic, use the description ‘matured in wooden barrels’. That would deal with the competition problem. It is in any case better to legalise this practice rather than, over a period of decades, to accept that many are doing it illegally, and so I think the approach we have opted for is the right one. </p>

 Mr President, I always have the privilege, when I make my way to Strasbourg, of driving through the wonderful regions of the Palatinate and Alsace, where I buy my wine. I am always impressed with the quality of the products of the European wine producers. My own country now also boasts eight wine producers, but I will not speak on their behalf. It strikes me as an important topic, if Europe has asked to license this technique. That is also evident from the large quantities of wine imports to which this technique is applied, and it would be too crazy for words if we were to deny European wine producers this opportunity.</p>
<p class="contents">I would, at the same time, regret it if the quality of European wines were to come under pressure as a result. I do not think that will be the case, because if you have true quality, then you can prove that there is a difference between the use of wood chippings and wooden barrels. After all, if a red or white wine has had the chance to age in good, solid barrels, then it will be easier to digest. That is the difference between the use of wood chippings and wooden barrels. I should like to emphasise that, and also call on the European wine producers, those who produce quality wine and are able to sell their wine without any problems, to continue to use wooden barrels in any event.</p>
<p class="contents">I would also draw your attention to other developments that have taken place in Europe. When large wooden barrels were abandoned in favour of steel ones, it was not a requirement to mention this on the label, and neither was this done. Express requests are now being made, though, for the use of wood chippings to be indicated on the label, and I can go along with this provided that the regions are given the freedom simply to introduce this obligation or not. What is not permitted in any event is for wine to be indicated as having been matured in wood, if this only involved wood chippings. That strikes me as crucial.</p>
<p class="contents">In that respect, I should like to concur with the words of Mr Langen when he states that we must exercise caution where red tape on the wine label is concerned. We need clarity in this area. As a citizen of a country where we drink more wine than we produce, I would call on the European Commission to give this due consideration in the new wine policy. </p>

 Mr President, ladies and gentlemen, thank you for your contributions to the discussion. I will be informing my fellow Commissioner Marian Fischer Böl of the interest that you have displayed.</p>
<p class="contents">As I already mentioned in my introductory statement, the use of oak shavings in wine production was already approved at a political level by the Council last year. Within the framework of the Wine Management Committee, there has been an exchange of views on the technical rules applying to the use of wood shavings, and the Commission’s proposal has won the support of most Member States. I consider the debate under way here today to be Parliament’s contribution to the discussion. The discussion is important because it forms part of the wider problem of how to improve the competitiveness of the European wine sector. There is a clear need for action. The Commission has just begun another crisis distillation of 5.6 million hectolitres of wine, which will cost the EU budget EUR 131 million in total. Expenditure on distillation regularly amounts to more than EUR 500 million per year. This is of course not sustainable in the long term.</p>
<p class="contents">The Commission will soon be adopting a communication on ways to reform the wine regime, which will undoubtedly form the subject of complex analysis and debate in Parliament. My fellow Commissioner Mrs Fisher Böl has remarked several times with regard to the future of the wine sector that the sector must increase the competitiveness of EU wine producers, improve the reputation for quality enjoyed by EU wine as the best wine in the world, win back old markets and also win new markets in the EU and throughout the world. We must create a wine regime that operates on the basis of clear, simple and effective rules, such as balancing supply and demand. We must create a wine regime which will retain the best traditions of wine-making in the EU, strengthen the social structure of many rural areas and ensure that all production will be environment-friendly.</p>
<p class="contents">The measures we are discussing today are fully in accordance with the above-stated goals. The future of the wine sector depends, among other things, on having a symbiotic link between the best traditions of the sector and practical modern developments.</p>
<p class="contents">Allow me to respond briefly to some of the points that have been raised. The first question was on why the Commission was not making it obligatory to identify wine that has been produced with the help of wood shavings. The Council Regulation sets out a specific number of mandatory details for wine labels, and only the Council can make it obligatory for labels to mention the wood shavings process. It is not possible to make this a mandatory requirement under a Commission Regulation, as stated in the proposal which the Wine Management Committee is assessing. The Commission in any case feels that the existing system of wine labelling is too complicated and too rigid, and that it would consequently be appropriate to simplify existing procedures and make them more flexible.</p>
<p class="contents">The use of oak shavings and pieces of oak in contact with wine as it matures has been permitted for 10 years now in most wine producing countries outside Europe, and wine produced in this way satisfies the wishes of consumers. The International Organisation of Vine and Wine, which is the international reference body in this sector, approved this process in 2001 and considers it to be a good wine-making process. There is therefore no reason for banning the process, or for banning wine produced in this way from being imported into the EU.</p>
<p class="contents">Ladies and gentlemen, the issue of wine processing is an issue of exceptional importance because wine is a traditional part of European agriculture. As I mentioned earlier, the Commission is drawing up the appropriate documents, and these will be debated in Parliament. On the issue of wine and the powers of the Commission in relation to labelling wine that has been produced through or with the aid of wood shavings, I feel that my communication included sufficient information on the procedural powers of the Commission. </p>

 Mr President, I have a follow-up question regarding the Commissioner's explanations. Did I understand him correctly? He said that there had been an agreement at political level since last year, but, according to my information, the infamous draft regulation amending Regulations No 1622/2000, No 884/2001 and No 753/2002 has not yet been adopted.</p>
<p class="contents">For my part, I simply asked the Commission if it agrees with not adopting this regulation in comitology prior to the debates we will be holding on the reform of the CMO for wine, because that is what we are interested in. Highly bureaucratic regulations are being made behind our backs, which is why I would ask that we avoid adopting them until we can hold debates here on the practices...</p>

Mr President, for many of us, the case of Timor has for many years served as a kind of laboratory for learning how to manage conflicts linked to a colonial heritage. At the same time it has served as an example allowing us to test, improve and correct certain international aid practices.</p>
<p class="contents">Nevertheless, the process of international accompaniment which led East Timor to regain its independence also has many grey areas, as usually happens in cases such as this. In view of what is happening at the moment, our first observation should probably be that the international withdrawal was rather premature, and I therefore believe that the Security Council’s decision to extend the United Nations mission in that country is absolutely right.</p>
<p class="contents">We must also acknowledge and welcome as very positive the Timorese authorities’ decision to ask for an international committee to carry out an investigation into the violent events of 5 May, when a group of hundreds of soldiers who had resigned from their posts clashed with others who were still in the army. Furthermore, these events took place within a context of general violence which has left a number of dead and wounded and thousands of refugees.</p>
<p class="contents">This is clearly not the situation that the international community wanted to see in Timor. We cannot therefore now shy away from this situation and we must show our complete solidarity with those who are working to find a solution to the problem. In particular, we must support the action being taken by President Xanana Gusmão and Minister Ramos Horta on behalf of the government.</p>
<p class="contents">Finally, I also believe that we must learn from past mistakes and in this Resolution we therefore call for the establishment of mechanisms for horizontal communication and cooperation amongst the international forces, with a view to providing a better service to the Timorese people, as well as effective restoration of public order and of normality in the functioning of the institutions. </p>

 East Timor is an independent, sovereign State that has been in existence for four years, whose people have struggled for decades against Indonesian occupation. It is a country that began life destroyed by the occupation. One could not ask the Timorese institutions to be any more democratic than they have been in the years since independence, a fact unchanged by recent events.</p>
<p class="contents">What is, in our view, required at this complex and difficult time is support for a return to normality, especially from the point of view of security, which is in fact already happening. The sovereignty of the East Timorese people must also be steadfastly protected, along with their freedom to choose their legitimate representatives. Furthermore, the legitimacy of the democratic functioning of the institutions in the country should be respected. The dynamics of foreign interference by the regional powers of Australia and Indonesia must also be rejected, as this has only served to worsen the situation. Genuine solidarity and cooperation with East Timor should be promoted, as this will contribute towards the country's economic and social development, and the well-being of the people.</p>
<p class="contents">Although the motion for a resolution before us addresses some of these concerns, its content is tainted by its biased approach to the political situation, which will only serve to fuel internal and external attempts to make political capital out of the situation and could exacerbate tension.</p>
<p class="contents">What Parliament should do right now is adopt an attitude of impartial, unequivocal support for the work and the efforts of all Timorese institutions, which is not the case with this motion for a resolution. What is more, the motion for a resolution sidesteps the real dangers of foreign interference, which, as has been well documented, has influenced the way in which events have turned out.</p>
<p class="contents">This approach is doubly dangerous: firstly, as it holds one of the sovereign Timorese institutions entirely responsible for the situation and, secondly, as it fails to warn of the potentially destabilising effect of more or less direct interference in a country already affected by the Indonesian occupation and by the destabilisation that armed militias have repeatedly attempted to cause.</p>
<p class="contents">Lastly, we feel that it is not appropriate at this time to raise the issue of the presence of UN blue helmets. The important thing at the moment is that the military forces stationed in the area should remain only until the situation has stabilised. They should be subject both to their national chain of command and to the Timorese authorities, in accordance with the bilateral agreements, with the constitutional framework of the country and with the standards of international law. In conclusion, this is a motion for a resolution that, in our view, does not reflect the development of the situation on the ground in all its complexity. </p>

Mr President, a few years ago East Timor was in everyone’s thoughts on account of the bad experiences it had in striving for independence and the suffering caused it by a harsh occupation for a quarter of a century before that. The country’s progress towards independence, the restoration of order and the commencement of international relief quickly made East Timor what for us Europeans was an example of the potential afforded by international solidarity and cooperation.</p>
<p class="contents">The recent unrest, violence and the huge numbers of refugees in East Timor have therefore been a disappointment for the international community. The disappointment has been especially great inasmuch as it showed that the international community’s faith in a situation where there would be permanent improvement in East Timor was well before its time.</p>
<p class="contents">Now we have to look the truth in the eyes and admit that it often takes more time to solve deep-rooted problems and provide follow-up than is possible using the United Nation’s resources, taxed as they are by a large number of crisis areas, if there is no additional investment. The joint proposal by six political groups for a motion for a resolution on East Timor has the backing of the Group of the Alliance of Liberals and Democrats for Europe and deserves wide support from the European Parliament as a whole.</p>

 Mr President, I have photographs here of the death and destruction in East Timor. They could be pictures from 1999, but they are not. They were sent by a friend a month ago, following the terrible date of 28 April when death and riots hit Dili again.</p>
<p class="contents">In 2002 I led the EU mission to monitor the presidential election followed by independence, and we saw clearly what a good job UNTAET had done under the much-lamented Sergio Vieira de Mello. We saw how Australia and the other international troops had kept the peace. We saw how UNHCR had helped the refugees come back from West Timor and elsewhere. Then they all left, and for a time, under President Xanana and the Government of East Timor, things looked good. But then the losers of the past struggles, those in the old militias who did not find jobs and others who were disgruntled exposed that dormant ethnic fault line between Loro Monu and Loro Sae, the west and east of East Timor, and tensions between army and police, and so on.</p>
<p class="contents">Now we must call back the United Nations with its agencies, including the civilian police, but this time both they and the international troops of Australia and Malaysia and others must stay to ensure stability, and this time the European Union must be closely involved again and certainly not cut its aid as dramatically as happened after 2002.</p>
<p class="contents">The latest member of the ACP is East Timor. We meet with them at the ACP-EU Joint Parliamentary Assembly in Vienna this coming week and I hope that we can all pull together to ensure that we close ranks to support the people of East Timor, so that they can renew that progress towards peace, stability and prosperity. </p>

 I was recently in Dili at the start of the recent period of violence among the Timorese. Tragic confrontations took place between elements of the police and the military. I also witnessed the poignant, dramatic moment of institutional unity, when the President, Prime Minister and the President of Parliament were forced to ask for help from foreign forces to restore order and political stability to the country.</p>
<p class="contents">I should like to point out that the Timorese people gave an enthusiastic welcome to the National Republican Guard, a branch of the Portuguese, and as such European, police. The Timorese authorities also demonstrated unity and convergence when two days ago they submitted to the United Nations Security Council requests to strengthen and extend the remit of the United Nations Office in East Timor (UNOTIL) from being a police mission under UN supervision to being a peace-keeping mission under the mandate and leadership of the UN, should the need arise. This European Parliament motion for a resolution supports these requests and demonstrates the concern of Parliament and the EU about the situation. It also demonstrates confidence that, with help from friends, East Timor will be able to overcome this serious crisis.</p>
<p class="contents">As European Socialists, we remain convinced that the people of East Timor will overcome this crisis associated with the difficulties of a growing democracy, just as it has overcome previous, more serious crises that have threatened their very existence. We also know that a great deal depends on us as Europeans and on the international community as a whole. The international community has a particular responsibility to guarantee that the State of East Timor and its people, who have fought against oppression for the independence and sovereignty of their country, have the future they deserve.</p>
<p class="contents">As Kofi Annan said this week, what is happening in East Timor is especially painful because the country is, and I quote, ‘a child of the international community’. The fragile foundations of the young Timorese democracy have been exposed in this crisis. Mr Annan went on to say: ‘both the Timorese and the international community as a whole have important lessons to learn from these events’. Some permanent Members of the Security Council need to examine their consciences. It is impossible to build nations with sound democratic institutions hurriedly in a just a few years. To declare ‘mission accomplished’ in order to save money will prove costly, and it is the people who will carry the can.</p>
<p class="contents">The situation can be rectified and nobody should question the viability of the independent, sovereign State of East Timor, which also enjoys independence and sovereignty over the country’s significant natural resources. Ian Martin, head of the United Nations Mission in East Timor (UNAMET), who helped with the split in 1999 and who was recently the UN Secretary-General's envoy in Dili, explained the day before yesterday that the crux of the matter was not whether East Timor was a failed State; for him, the bottom line was that this is a country that had been in existence for four years, that was learning to deal with the weight of responsibility arising from independence and to address the challenges inherent in a democratic system.</p>
<p class="contents">This is where we in the EU can make all the difference. In this connection, the recommendations in this motion for a resolution to the Commission and the Council are intended to strengthen European assistance for consolidating the democratic institutions, in such a way that human rights and reconciliation are promoted in East Timor. Accordingly, Parliament welcomes the unanimous decision taken by the Timorese authorities to seek an international commission of inquiry to look into recent incidents that have led to a high number of casualties and to thousands of Timorese fleeing their homes.</p>
<p class="contents">Parliament will remain vigilant, and is planning to send an <span class="italic">ad hoc</span>
 mission next October. We hope that the efforts of Nobel Peace Prize winners President Xanana Gusmão and government minister Ramos Horta will succeed in overcoming the political crisis, in such a way that the mission can focus on European aid for development in East Timor. </p>

 Mr President, East Timor formally gained independence in 1975. However, the country was then immediately occupied by Indonesia and its left-wing, Islamic dictatorship. This small Catholic country with a population of 300 000 remained under cruel enemy occupation for 25 years. After regaining independence, it continued to be the subject of various international conflicts, <span class="italic">inter alia</span>
 because of its natural resources.</p>
<p class="contents">East Timor must be supported by international organisations and the United Nations mission must continue. This mission should not be limited to 130 soldiers, but should involve as many troops as are necessary to protect East Timor’s weary Catholic population from social unrest and conflict.</p>
<p class="contents">Ladies and gentlemen, if one bears in mind that the murderous regime of Gadaffi, the murderous regime of Castro and other murderous regimes joined the United Nations Commission on Human Rights, one can only wonder whether these international organisations wield enough authority. The regimes mentioned above are all members of the Commission on Human Rights.</p>
<p class="contents">If we also take into account the fact that our Parliament, which should lead by example, is once again today debating same-sex marriage and that one of the Member States of the European Union has decided to grant civil rights to great apes, then we may surely wonder if we have sufficient authority to assist those people who are most persecuted and who suffer the most. They are people who truly have more pressing concerns than those which are often debated in this House. </p>

 Mr President, it saddens me that back in 1999 I made my maiden speech in the European Parliament on East Timor, shortly before the United Nations sent in a peacekeeping force which paved the way for its eventual independence. To date, it remains the youngest member of the United Nations, as from 2002.</p>
<p class="contents">Here we are again debating violent unrest in the territory and once again Australia, New Zealand, Portugal and Malaysia have had to intervene to establish law and order in what is now a sovereign State.</p>
<p class="contents">I would particularly like to express appreciation of the efforts made by Australia in its region in its peacekeeping role, as we recently also saw in the case of the Solomon Islands. I support the efforts made by President Xanana Gusmao and the international community to bypass the prime minister, who seems to be refusing to resign and is very intransigent, and to disarm the paramilitary groups, re-establish law and order and enable aid and reconstruction to flow back into the territory.</p>
<p class="contents">I am sure this House will support the European Union and the United Nations in whatever way is necessary to achieve lasting piece and reconciliation on this tragic but beautiful remote island. </p>

I should like to say how astonished I was that these events in East Timor happened as long as four years after the recognition of that country, since I had believed that, unfortunately, all the factors were present for them to have taken place before then.</p>
<p class="contents">Anyone who imagines that, because East Timor was granted international recognition, it then had everything in place in terms of democratic and other structures and in relation to education, the environment, human rights and the courts is deluding himself. I think we were fooling ourselves in imagining that, because we had recognised East Timor’s independence and because the relevant structures were now supposedly established there, the country no longer needed our help to progress in terms of democracy and compliance with human rights.</p>
<p class="contents">Anyone alert to what was happening in East Timor would have realised that, often, the only unifying factor there was the occupying forces. Following the recognition of East Timor’s independence, it was clear that the situation was not about to take a turn for the better. There was the poverty factor, East Timor being, as we know, one of the poorest countries in the world. Then there was the absence of structures and the possibility, which subsequently became a reality, of oil suddenly being discovered there.</p>
<p class="contents">We must, therefore, benefit from the example of East Timor and learn lessons from what has happened there. I conclude that if East Timor needs help, as is in fact the case, this should be provided both by the international community and by the religious and voluntary sectors. </p>

 Mr President, I would echo the words of my group colleague, Mr Romeva i Rueda, and emphasise everything that he and others have said on the situation in East Timor.</p>
<p class="contents">Here we are again in an urgency debate in which the few Members present will largely agree that it is bad that bad things are happening somewhere in the world. The Commissioner will doubtless largely agree with us. Though I would suggest – and I would ask the Commissioner for his view – that it would be useful for the Council to be represented in these debates in order to make them that little bit more relevant and meaningful.</p>
<p class="contents">As I say, I emphasise and reiterate the views of Mr Tannock and Mr Romeva i Rueda about the situation in East Timor. This motion for a resolution has a number of concrete steps that we ourselves can take to alleviate the situation in that troubled part of the world. It is tragic that a country has regained its independence in order to collapse into such anarchy and that, so many years later, it is still not that much further forward. We have a number of ideas in this motion for a resolution to help alleviate that and I hope we will be acting on them. </p>

 Mr President, sometimes it is important to explore the background to a situation. East Timor is a country cursed with oil and gas. If a country is rich, powerful and developed it can be blessed with such natural resources, but it seems that the fate of a poor country with such gifts is exploitation, strife and international meddling. Like many other countries – Côte d’Ivoire, Uzbekistan and Chechnya, etc. – East Timor has been exploited by bigger powers. It is inexcusable that Australia, a country that likes to see itself as an advanced and peaceful nation, should be occupying and drilling in the gas and oil fields under the East Timor Sea, and that Australia should be justifying that robbery on the basis that Indonesia – East Timor’s most recent exploiter – gave it the right to drill there. What is more inexcusable is that we have tolerated this.</p>
<p class="contents">We should encourage East Timor in any way we can and be sure that our intentions in doing so are pure and not based on our gaining an advantage in oil or gas, and let East Timor get on with the job of developing a viable, peaceful and stable nation. </p>

 Mr President, ladies and gentlemen, the current crisis in East Timor gives rise to a number of complex questions. Has the international community failed to prevent the outbreak of violence? What lessons emerge from this for the donor countries?</p>
<p class="contents">According to the most recent reports, the security situation is calmer, although looting and clashes are continuing, and have resulted in more than 100 000 people being evacuated into the camps. These evacuees are now receiving assistance from humanitarian organisations, including partners of the Commission that have already supplied aid to this country before. We must do much more, however, especially in terms of providing security, protection, food, water and hygiene facilities, as well as health care and shelters.</p>
<p class="contents">The political situation in the country is very complicated. As a result of dismissing one third of the armed forces, deep social and economic tensions affecting the entire country have risen to the surface. Mass unemployment and persistent poverty are caused primarily by political factors. Ethnic differences may also play a role, although they are not in themselves the cause of the basic economic and political problems.</p>
<p class="contents">What can the European Commission do? In the short term the Commission is determined to help the country overcome its current crisis by providing humanitarian aid to the evacuees. The Commission has already given some of its humanitarian partners the task of amending ongoing projects so as to redirect aid to address the most pressing needs of the people in the camps. The Commission is also drawing up a decision on financing, which will meet the additional humanitarian needs of the inhabitants. At the same time we should try to find ways to assist in the political process. The EU has from the outset been determined to assist the government and people of East Timor. A solution will not be easy, since the current crisis manifests itself at both the government level and at the level of socially disadvantaged members of society.</p>
<p class="contents">Both the UN and the international community are continuing to play their role here. But East Timor cannot succeed – either now or in the future – merely through the presence of UN peacekeeping forces, but first and foremost through development and democracy. The next parliamentary elections in 2007 should provide an opportunity to support democracy and will at the same time be a test for the government of East Timor and its citizens, as they decide which path to follow. The Commission will continue to consult closely over all these matters with Member States, partner countries and UN agencies, and it will of course continue the political dialogue with the authorities in East Timor both on a bilateral level and within the framework of the Cotonou Agreement.</p>
<p class="contents">Every viable democratic state needs strong institutions, operating under transparent rules, and the rules establishing human rights are a cornerstone of democracy. I fear that some of the institutions in East Timor have not met our expectations in this regard. The country secured its independence precisely because it was able to extend to its citizens the rights denied to them in the past. The international non-governmental organisation Human Rights Watch has published a detailed report on this topic and I will therefore focus only on selected areas.</p>
<p class="contents">There has clearly been some progress. One example of this would be the office of the mediator for human rights. I am also delighted to mention the preparation of a bilateral commission on rights and friendship with Indonesia, and I hope that it will enjoy a broad mandate. There is a need, however, for progress in the functioning of the police force and the justice system as a whole, as well as in the areas of freedom of expression and association.</p>
<p class="contents">In this regard our support will continue. Our latest project involves financing the Commission for Reception, Truth and Reconciliation. This project has made it possible to gather important information on violations of human rights in the past. The report from this Commission was published in 2005. We are now considering a further contribution to the installation of peace in this country.</p>
<p class="contents">Both the Members of this Parliament and the citizens of East Timor should know that the European Union is a determined backer of the peace process in this country. </p>

Mr President, Syria has in recent years been set on a course of democratic reform, especially after the accession to power of President Bashar Al-Assad. Unfortunately, progress has been disappointingly slow, mainly because the emergency laws, introduced under exceptional circumstances 43 years ago, are still in operation today. Regrettably, in the past few months in particular, numerous violations of human rights against politicians, lawyers, writers and other civilians have been reported and confirmed by independent agencies such as Amnesty International. Some, but not all, of those incidents are listed in the motion for a resolution.</p>
<p class="contents">We hope and expect that the Syrian Government will take immediate and decisive steps to remedy the human rights situation. Ratification, without further delay, of the Convention against Torture and Other Cruel, Inhuman or Degrading Treatment or Punishment would certainly be a step in the right direction. As, of course, would the immediate release from custody and cessation of harassment of human rights activists living and working in Syria.</p>
<p class="contents">Syria and the EU have many political, economic and cultural ties and it is our firm wish and honest desire that such ties be strengthened in the future. To this end, an association agreement between the EU and Syria is currently waiting to be signed. We are optimistically confident that the Syrian authorities will note the concerns expressed in this motion for a resolution with due seriousness and that they will view the necessity of enhancing respect for human rights in their country with the importance it so rightly deserves. Furthermore, that they will accordingly abide by the international principles of respect for human rights diligently and responsibly. </p>

 Mr President, the European Parliament has raised the question many times of infringements of human rights and basic political freedoms in Syria.</p>
<p class="contents">The Syrian authorities are notorious for detaining civil society activists and defence lawyers in political cases, as well as participants of foreign conferences on human rights after their return home. These arrests contravene Article 38 of the Syrian Constitution, which guarantees each citizen ‘the right to freely and openly express opinions in speech and writing and by all other means of expression’. The Syrian State of Emergency Law, which has been in force since 8 March 1963, also does not justify arresting and holding people in custody without trial for having freely expressed their opinion.</p>
<p class="contents">In May this year, the Syrian security service Amn al-Dawla detained 12 signatories of a petition calling on the Syrian authorities to improve relations between Syria and Lebanon by respecting the sovereignty of each of these countries. In the first half of May, the signatures of about 300 intellectuals and civil society activists in Syria and Lebanon were collected for the petition. On 14 May, the well-known journalist and universally respected representative of the domestic opposition Michel Kilo was detained. On 16 May, two further human rights activists, Nidal Darwish and Mahmud Mer’i, were arrested; more people were detained the following day, including the well-known defence lawyer Anwar al-Bunni. Ten days before he was detained, the Syrian Bar Association had suspended Anwar al-Bunni’s membership of this professional body. Anwar al-Bunni was supposed to become the director of the Centre for Human Rights, financed by the European Union, which was meant to start operating in Damascus. The majority of those detained between 14 and 17 May are being held in the central prison in Adra, near Damascus.</p>
<p class="contents">The European Parliament calls on the Syrian Government and Parliament for the immediate release of these people, and for the political system in Syria to respect basic political and civil rights. </p>

 Mr President, Syria is on the receiving end of very open threats of war from the outside world. The USA, for example, listed the country as part of what they called the ‘axis of evil’, and the EU, too, is very forthright in its criticism of the Syrian regime.</p>
<p class="contents">At the same time, though, there is very close cooperation with Syria; for example, terrorist suspects are flown out to Syria and tortured there. Various EU Member States also cooperate very closely with Syria, with the Dutch state bringing Syrian refugees in the Netherlands face to face with representatives of the regime.</p>
<p class="contents">Within Syria itself, there is increasing repression of the democratic opposition, particularly of those who signed the so-called Damascus-Beirut petition, which emphasises the ‘necessity of a definitive acknowledgement on the part of Syria of the independence of the Lebanon’. This declaration also states that external influence and aggression, for example on the part of Israel and the USA, are rejected, and the petition includes the same statement.</p>
<p class="contents">A number of months ago, the Left Group had as a guest in this House, Michel Kilo, a member of the Syrian opposition; today, he is in a Syrian jail. It should also be noted that many of those arrested are adherents of the Left. We demand the release of all these detainees and also an end, once and for all, to the threats to Syria from the outside world, notably from the USA and also the EU. We must support Syria’s democratic opposition. </p>

 Mr President, firstly I would like to welcome four representatives from the Syrian opposition who have come here from different parts of Europe to support their countrymen.</p>
<p class="contents">Anwar al-Bunni, Michel Kilo, Khalil Hussein, Safwan Tayfour, Mahmoud Issa, Fateh Jammous, Suleiman Achmar, Nidal Derwiche, Suleiman Shummor, Ghalem Amer, Muhammad Mahfud, Mahmoud Mer’i and Kamal Labwani are only a few of those who were imprisoned in the cruel and inhuman jails of the Syrian intelligence services on 19 May. They were imprisoned because they, together with 500 other intellectuals, signed a petition calling for the normalisation of relations with Lebanon. They were imprisoned because they want peace, stability and normal life to prevail in the Middle East. They were imprisoned because they want the very same things that we want.</p>
<p class="contents">Kamal Labwani came to us a year ago to share here with us the outlook as regards the situation in Syria. He told us that when he went back he would be imprisoned. He arrived at Damascus airport and was imprisoned. Today he faces a life sentence and so far we have done nothing to help. Anwar al-Bunni had just accepted the post of Director in the Centre for Human Rights financed by the European Union. He was therefore immediately imprisoned.</p>
<p class="contents">Our responsibility for their imprisonment is clear. Let us be responsible for their freedom. How can we work and live here in dignity if those who come here to talk and to work for us face life imprisonment? We urge you, Commission, Council, Member States, and especially the European public, to help us free those who are tortured, abused, imprisoned and killed, because they want their country and their countrymen to live in dignity and peace.</p>
<p class="contents">The authoritarian regime in Syria runs an enormous number of abnormally cruel political prisons. Let Syria free all its political prisoners before we have further dialogue on the Syrian association agreement. </p>

 Mr President, we are correct and honour-bound in this Chamber to take note of and highlight human rights abuses in Syria. To express our concern is the very least we can do. This motion does, in truth, little more than that.</p>
<p class="contents">I grew up in the Middle East, so I know the region pretty well. We also need to take account of the wider backdrop to these issues. The fact is that we in Europe are not seen as the good guys. We are not seen as having clean hands. I would refer you to the official government statement of the Ministry of Foreign Affairs of Syria issued on 19 May 2006. It says: ‘States which allowed secret flying prisons to cross their airspace and to use their airports and which permitted secret prisons on their territories, which represents a clear infraction of the simplest human rights and international treaties related to this topic, do not have the right to propagate the defence of human rights.’</p>
<p class="contents">We have left ourselves in a position where Syria can accuse us of breaching human rights. It is a crazy world, right enough. We are not seen as being the good guys. Hypocrisy is the most odious charge we can be accused of. We stand accused of it right now, with some justification. We need to do more to put our own house in order, as well as look after Syria’s. </p>

 Mr President, I was in Lebanon recently, and I saw that hope is emerging there for the building of democracy and of a democratic country, and for state sovereignty to encompass the whole territory.</p>
<p class="contents">For this reason, Syria is also the key to peace in the Middle East. Syria refuses to recognise Lebanon or to establish diplomatic relations with the country. It is detaining people who signed the Beirut petition demanding the normalisation of relations between Syria and Lebanon. It is arresting journalists, lawyers, workers, officials and members of the opposition on trivial charges.</p>
<p class="contents">We must insist that the Syrian authorities release those who are being illegally held. The conditions in which prisoners are held must change. Syria should also release prisoners who have been held for years and who are recognised in Lebanon as missing, and whose mothers have asked for intervention and their release. We should insist that Syria ratify the Convention against Torture and Other Cruel, Inhuman or Degrading Treatment. </p>

 Mr President, everyone wishes to live a dignified life in freedom, and deserves to do so. Promoting human rights and democratic principles is a task that has a global range; it is also the task of the European Parliament.</p>
<p class="contents">History, and often the most recent history, shows that the best guarantee of human rights is a correctly functioning democratic state. This means a state in which the rights of the citizen are respected, and in which each citizen, irrespective of gender, faith or caste, is treated identically.</p>
<p class="contents">We cannot consent to the life of a woman being sacrificed on the altar of her family’s honour in the 21st century. We cannot consent to the fact that in a civilised world, in order to justify abuses, a state of emergency was introduced, which serves as a cover for groundless arrests, the use of torture or the murder of civilians, journalists, lawyers or activists fighting in defence of human rights. For these reasons, I am in favour of adopting the motion for a resolution. </p>

 Mr President, the previous speakers have told the House about dramatic cases in which Syrian oppositionists have been detained in recent months, and yet violations of fundamental rights have been taking place in Syria for over 40 years.</p>
<p class="contents">It is intolerable that in a country that is a close neighbour of the European Union, absolute authority should be held by one family clan and their friends and relations. For over 40 years a state of emergency has been in place, and the parliament is an institution which is completely subordinate to one party, namely the Baas party, and which is devoid of legislative authority. Citizens do not have any electoral rights; they do not have the right to free association, nor do they have political rights. In connection with this there is no kind of legal opposition. Criticism of the authorities is impossible, and omnipresent secret services and corrupt courts with unlimited power to carry out arrests and use torture complete the dramatic picture.</p>
<p class="contents">However, one of the most urgent problems in Syria is discrimination against a minority, namely the Kurdish minority. The one-and-a-half-million-strong Kurdish minority is currently deprived of the most basic civil rights. There is a total ban on using the Kurdish language, as there is on any manifestation of Kurdish culture. The Kurds do not have Syrian citizenship, and as a consequence they have no passports, no access to education or to the health service and no right to own land.</p>
<p class="contents">We cannot remain inactive in view of this. </p>

 Mr President, having just, at short notice, taken over my colleague Mr Maat’s one minute’s worth of speaking time, let me say that I share his great concern about the human rights situation in Syria. The right to free expression of opinion is, to all practical purposes, non-existent. Repressive measures are taken not only against journalists and civil society activists, but also, and increasingly, against ethnic and religious minorities. It is of the utmost importance that the EU should delay signing an association agreement with Syria until there have been substantial improvements in the human rights situation. We all know that paper is patient; if we were to sign it, the pressure would be taken off the regime, despite the continuing arrest and torture of supporters of the opposition and even though the situation as regards freedom of opinion would not have changed and Syria was still not seeking reconciliation with Lebanon. For the EU to put pressure on Syria is not to threaten it; on the contrary, I believe that it would constitute legitimate action against a pretty authoritarian regime on the part of a union of democratic states. </p>

 Mr President, ladies and gentlemen, I thank you for giving me an opportunity to speak today about the serious human rights situation in Syria.</p>
<p class="contents">The Commission is monitoring the situation closely and is disturbed by recent developments.</p>
<p class="contents">At the beginning of this year we had some grounds for optimism. The government released hundreds of political prisoners. It also undertook to limit the use of emergency laws by restricting them to activities that threatened state security, and it was preparing to set up a national council on human rights. At the time we warmly welcomed these positive steps.</p>
<p class="contents">Today, however, we can only lament the set-backs. The authorities are forcing through further restrictions on basic freedoms. A wave of arrests in May is the most prominent example of this worrying trend, affecting the intellectuals and defenders of human rights who signed the declarations of Damascus and Beirut.</p>
<p class="contents">Mr President, ladies and gentlemen, both you and I know some of these representatives of civil society personally. They have peaceful intentions. We cannot accept the persecution and intimidation of human rights defenders and government critics, or arbitrary imprisonment and the use of solitary confinement. Syria does not respect its obligations arising from the UN treaties on civil and political rights. The EU therefore responded decisively on 19 May with a public declaration calling for the immediate release of all political prisoners.</p>
<p class="contents">The Commission has fears particularly because one of the persons imprisoned is leading a project within the framework of the European Initiative for Democracy and Human Rights.</p>
<p class="contents">Making public declarations is not enough, of course. We must monitor individual cases and increase our involvement with Syrian partners. The fact that there is no valid Euro-Mediterranean association agreement for Syria means that we are lacking the political basis for an open resolution of these issues with the government, as is the case with other countries. Together with embassies of the Member States in Damascus, however, we are making full use of diplomatic channels and we will continue to do so.</p>
<p class="contents">I feel quite sure that the European Parliament will be our unswerving ally in supporting these efforts. </p>

Mr President, the primary objective of our debate today is to save the life of an innocent man. Song Jong Nam is a North Korean man aged 48, who was arrested and tortured by North Korean authorities in January 2006, and was subsequently sentenced to death without a court procedure. The date of the execution is not known. We strongly hope that he is still alive, and will be released as a result of the pressure exerted by the international protest.</p>
<p class="contents">Son Jong Nam is an innocent man. His crime is that he left his country, because he was unable to bear the oppression; he subsequently became a Christian, the Chinese authorities returned him to North Korea, and in the meantime he made comments criticising the system. All he did was exercise his human rights. Today, this is punishable by death in North Korea. His case reflects the direness of the situation of human rights in North Korea. Tens of thousands of people are imprisoned in camps and forced labour camps, political prisoners are constantly tortured, many are executed, the majority of the population are destitute, and millions of people are starving in this country. The leaders of the country are responsible for their citizens, and I strongly hope that they will not manage to avoid being called to account.</p>
<p class="contents">The European Union has indicated on several occasions that it is ready for a dialogue on human rights, but the North Korean authorities have always rejected it. We are also ready to provide humanitarian assistance, but only if it can reach those who really need it; we do not want to support the government authorities with our aid.</p>
<p class="contents">Finally, the practice of the Chinese authorities is unacceptable. Chinese authorities have been continuously returning North Korean refugees, fully knowing that the majority of the refugees will be locked up in camps straight away; therefore we call on the Chinese authorities to address this issue in conformance with the international standards of refugee rights. Also, we call on the European Commission and the European Council to act more firmly against the North Korean government, to inform them more firmly that we are not indifferent to the way people live in North Korea, that we support them, and we want North Korea to observe human rights. </p>

 North Korea has caught the eye of journalists and scientists who collect knowledge about this state as being the world’s most remarkable country. It is moody and unpredictable in negotiations with other countries, and its people appear to be living in unimaginable unanimity and discipline, with boundless loyalty to the mysterious leader and in unrivalled mourning should that leader pass away. Despite its virtually complete isolation from the outside world, the country has developed an urban environment and its own nuclear industry.</p>
<p class="contents">Some people outside North Korea sing the praises of the remarkable successes that have been publicised by its regime. In their view, those successes were achieved thanks to a superior system and despite the opposition of the hostile outside world since the end of the war in 1953. People peddling those successes have a hard time convincing anyone, though. Apart from a handful of admirers, it is said that hardly any Europeans could live there, or would want to live here for that matter. The success stories were followed by the food shortage. Also, there is no longer a deafening silence with regard to what eventually happens to the people in North Korea who do not fit into that model.</p>
<p class="contents">Despite the constitutional freedom of religion and despite the ratification of the International Covenant on Civil and Political Rights, anyone who could pose a threat to the regime is dealt with at its own discretion. The death penalty is also applied as a political instrument. Repression and hunger mean that tens of thousands of people have fled to China.</p>
<p class="contents">In the motion for a resolution, it was decided not to repeat dozens of years of cold war language, but instead it contains sensible proposals, addressed to the government, on human rights, the death penalty, the release of prisoners, freedom of expression, the adaptation of legislation and permission for international inspections. Neighbouring countries are also asked not to return refugees, and food aid is supported. My group welcomes this approach. </p>

 Mr President, more and more frequently, alarming information is reaching us from North Korea about widespread infringements of human rights. The intimidation of citizens, torture and public executions have become part of the miserable everyday existence of the country, not to mention the restrictions on freedom of speech or religious faith.</p>
<p class="contents">Numerous witnesses testify that more than 200 000 people could be held in Korean forced labour camps. Prisoners are subject to torture, and live in inconceivable conditions. All opposition and resistance to the governing Korean Workers’ Party is firmly put down, and punishment is meted out not only to the oppositionists, but also to their entire families. The death penalty, which is still used in North Korea, is imposed mainly for political reasons. Local media are censored, and access to international media is extremely limited.</p>
<p class="contents">Besides the political situation, the economic situation is also very difficult in North Korea. The local population is escaping to China en masse, not only because of political repression, but also because of growing problems relating to hunger. Against a background of general shortages, the authorities are distributing food in such a way that high-ranking party and military officials are favoured, and ordinary citizens are missed out. The North Korean Government consistently refuses to allow access to the country for United Nations observers or for non-governmental organisations working in defence of human rights. What is more, Korea completely ignores the recommendations of the United Nations Human Rights Committee.</p>
<p class="contents">Given the lack of any kind of will or cooperation on the part of the North Korean Government, the international community cannot sit back and watch as individual lives and human dignity are disregarded in the country. We have to react to the current situation in the country in order to force the North Korean Government to respect basic human rights, and at least as a first step to open the borders for independent international organisations willing to provide humanitarian aid to the local population.</p>

 Mr President, the situation in North Korea, if one thinks about it at all, appears depressing and hopeless, but I find myself having, time and time again, to think back 25 years to the days when I was a young assistant in this House and was fortunate enough to have had a hand in the first resolution – which was in support of Charter 77. There were three MEPs who worked very hard at the time to bring it about: Klaus Hänsch, who is still a Member here; Otto von Habsburg and Jiří Pelikán, who used to sit as an MEP for Italy.</p>
<p class="contents">Today, we find ourselves debating human rights under the chairmanship of a Czech president, with a Czech Commissioner, the Iron Curtain – not least thanks to the courage of the peoples of Central and Eastern Europe – having disappeared some 15 or 16 years ago. That should strengthen us to hold fast to the truth that the inhuman communist regime in North Korea must disappear as well, and that it will do so.</p>
<p class="contents">Along with Cuba and a few others, it is among the last Communist terror regimes on earth, and we should deploy all peaceful means of exerting pressure – whether political or economic – in working towards the overthrow of this Communist dynasty and its repressive system, towards the release of the campaigners for freedom and resistance fighters in it, of whom there are over 200 000, for these people – who want nothing more than to practice a religion or to express their opinions freely – to be able to enjoy freedom of conscience, and the setting at liberty of those persons from Japan, South Korea and many other countries, who, on the flimsiest of pretexts, have been locked up in North Korea. In the case of many of them, it is not known whether they are still alive, and an urgent enquiry needs to be made in order to find out where these individuals are; that is the very least that this regime must do.</p>
<p class="contents">It is for that reason that I would like to make it clear that we are right to make the demand contained in the motion for a resolution, namely that we should resume the human rights dialogue with this country that was suspended in 2003 and that we should ask the Commission and the Council to conduct, in that context, in-depth conversations on human rights. We in this House, though, have, over and above that, the task of exerting massive pressure and of ensuring that the response to this is not in the form of words alone, but also of deeds and of the necessary political and economic pressure.</p>

 As a historian, I have, through my studies, acquired some knowledge of the atrocities meted out by the totalitarian regimes in the 20th century. What would it have been like for the citizens of those dictatorships, though? As Mr Posselt has already said, it is difficult for us in the free West to imagine. This afternoon, we will briefly dwell on the Communist reign of terror in North Korea. Mr President, the juxtaposition of North Korea and ‘human rights’, words so often used by this House, is essentially shocking and should prompt us to be quiet. By doing this, though, we would leave the so ill-treated North Koreans to their own devices.</p>
<p class="contents">Needless to say, the beloved leader Kim Jong Il has every reason to favour our political inertness. Moreover, there is no need for us to expose him and his cronies, for, shockingly, regimes of terror have a habit, in the first instance, of taking care of that all by themselves, even though Pyongyang has been sealed as hermetically as possible and reports from and about the place are few and far between. Indeed, the accounts of North Korean refugees speak volumes.</p>
<p class="contents">The urgent question that arises here is: what is the European Union to do about this depressing situation in North Korea? In my view, the Council and the Commission should primarily urge China to apply its growing influence in its neighbouring country North Korea in a positive way, in the sense of an urgent and external restraint of Pyongyang policy. In the final analysis, Beijing stands to benefit from this as well.</p>
<p class="contents">This may sound very pragmatic, but this message only aims to ease the material and spiritual suffering of North Korean citizens. People, fellow creatures of God, subject to like passions as we are, yearn for freedom of movement and, lest we forget, thought, speech and, above all, faith. </p>

Mr President, sadly, North Korea remains a constant in terms of human rights violations.</p>
<p class="contents">Furthermore, far from helping to improve its image, certain attitudes on the part of the North Korean Government are simply worsening it. One example of this is that government’s repeated decision not to allow access to the United Nations Special Rapporteur on the human rights situation and the United Nations Special Rapporteur on the right to food, as well as several humanitarian and human rights NGOs.</p>
<p class="contents">Numerous reports warn of the increasing numbers of people leaving the country as refugees, as well as the existence of practices such as torture, summary executions, arbitrary detentions and imprisonment in inhuman conditions and without any guarantees of legal defence.</p>
<p class="contents">Any opposition to the regime is prohibited and any criticism of government policy leads to harsh reprisals. The case of Sonj Nam, who has been tortured and sentenced to death, despite repeated calls for the case to be reviewed with greater guarantees, is just one example of this, as previous speakers have mentioned.</p>
<p class="contents">For all of these reasons, we must once again take this opportunity to call upon the North Korean Government: firstly, to comply with the human rights principles and commitments laid down in international law and to incorporate them into its own legislation; secondly, to abolish the death penalty; thirdly, to release all prisoners jailed for wishing freely to exercise their fundamental rights; and, finally, to guarantee freedom of expression and freedom of movement.</p>
<p class="contents">Furthermore, we must call upon the neighbouring People's Republic of China to cease repatriating refugees fleeing North Korea towards South Korea.</p>
<p class="contents">Finally, bearing in mind that the European Union was the first and only body to establish a dialogue on human rights with the North Korean Government, and bearing in mind also that this practice ceased when in 2003 the Council of Ministers sponsored a declaration on human rights in North Korea within the High Commission on Human Rights, it is also urgent that we re-establish that dialogue as soon as possible in order to restore that forum, as has been said. </p>

 Mr President, it is no accident that the motion for a resolution on communist North Korea was tabled by almost all political groups in our Parliament. It means that, in this case, we speak with one voice. This is good news, because by doing so we strengthen our position.</p>
<p class="contents">We are speaking today about a peculiar kind of political Jurassic Park, about a regime that froze in time 50 or 30 years ago. It is the only situation of its kind in the world, because even in Fidel Castro’s Cuba there is opposition, and Castro cannot put everyone in prison. We must speak openly about this political archaeological site. We must support the diplomatic activities of the Troika. As has already been mentioned, we should put a stop to the forced repatriation of refugees from North Korea, who have been hiding in China, strange as this may seem. It is good that there are no differences in Members’ views of communist North Korea. Let us hope that the European Commission and the Council share our position. </p>

 Mr President, as various speakers before me have already pointed out, freedom, our first European value, for which many of the new Member States have had to fight for half a century, is the most important human right here on earth. Alongside Cuba, North Korea, which is today’s topic, is one of the world’s last remaining Communist tyrannies. Unless one is a faithful slave of the regime, human life is worth nothing to this ruthless Communist regime.</p>
<p class="contents">As has already been pointed out, in this Communist paradise, what little food there is goes to the privileged elites, the military and the security services. The rest of the population is forced to abide by a rationing system, the so-called public distribution system, that has been designed in such a way as to ensure that everyone remains immobile and obedient. Recently, the operations of the World Food Programme were suspended by the regime and the private sale of grain was banned. A similar criminal policy in the early 90s claimed the lives of millions of people, and to think that some groups in this House fraternise with the people who keep such a regime alive. </p>

 Mr President, ladies and gentlemen, North Korea is one of the most problematic countries that the European Union has passed an opinion on in connection with respect for human rights.</p>
<p class="contents">This applies for two fundamental reasons: first, there is a regime of rigid control in place in North Korea, and therefore the public receive only scraps of information on human rights abuses in the country. Secondly, North Korea views international intervention on human rights as a covert attempt to destabilise their society or even to overthrow their government. As an example of this attitude we might recall their recent reaction to the motion for a resolution on North Korea submitted by the European Union to the UN General Assembly last year. Korea afterwards demanded that the European Union and other donors terminate their humanitarian aid programmes. We might also recall the explosive reaction to the letter sent by the UN special rapporteurs in April warning about the situation of Mr Son Jong Nam.</p>
<p class="contents">North Korea has one of the worst human rights records in the world. For this reason the Commission and the Member States of the EU have been raising the question of human rights in talks with North Korean officials, and they will continue to do so. They hold fast to that position despite the fact that a recent meeting of three political leaders was postponed in retaliation for the UN General Assembly resolution.</p>
<p class="contents">The impending execution of Mr Son Jong Nam and the unusually large volume of information that has come out about this and about his imprisonment is extremely significant. Representatives of the Commission and of several Member States met with top North Korean officials on 2, 3, 11 and 24 May in order to express their serious concerns over this case and to emphasise their increasing alarm over the state of human rights in North Korea generally. In this context they referred particularly to the death penalty.</p>
<p class="contents">I would like to assure you once again that the Commission will continue to cooperate closely over all of these issues with the country holding the presidency and will maintain contact with the European Parliament.</p>
<p class="contents">In view of the fact that the Chinese authorities are sending refugees back to North Korea, the EU has repeatedly expressed serious concerns over the situation within the framework of the human rights dialogue with China. The lack of will on the part of the Chinese authorities to pursue this problem does not in any way weaken the EU’s determination to find a proper solution to this problem. The issue is still under discussion.</p>
<p class="contents">Ladies and gentlemen, the human rights situation in North Korea is a theme that we must pursue and we will pursue. Of this I am in no doubt. </p>

 This oral amendment has obtained cross-group consensus. It is aimed at reflecting the request made by the authorities in East Timor at the United Nations Security Council for a peace-keeping mission with a UN mandate, should this prove necessary. The amendment is aimed at expressing this request. The paragraph would therefore read as follows: </p>
<p class="contents">‘Stresses that the process of gradual reduction of the UN mission in East Timor over the last four years must be reversed and asks for the urgent deployment of a UN-led police force to help restore stability, and a UN-mandated peacekeeping force as requested by the East Timorese authorities on 13 June 2006;’ </p>

 Mr President, We agreed in the course of debate that we would call for the release of the prisoners, especially of those who had signed the Damascus-Beirut petition. Two days ago, two more of them were taken into custody, and my oral amendment involves the addition of both of their names, so that it reads, in German: ‘<span class="italic">ebenso wie die kürzlich in Syrien erfolgten Festnahmen von Yasser Melhem und Omar Adlabi’ </span>
or, in English: ‘whereas also the recent arrests in Syria of Mr Yasser Melhem and Mr Omar Adlabi …’. </p>

<p>(DE) Article 37 of Regulation (EC) No 1698/2005 on support for rural development by the EAFRD provides for natural handicap payments in mountain areas and payments in other areas with handicaps.</p>

<p>At the beginning of 2008, the Commission intends to submit a proposal for a regulation amending certain provisions of Regulation (EC) No 1698/2005 so as to lay down the criteria for designating areas with natural handicaps. This would enter into force on 1 January 2010.</p>

<p>Given that genetically modified crops are an increasingly common feature of European agriculture and that the EU is under pressure from the WTO not to allow individual countries to ban these crops, does the Council have any plans to develop a coherent policy in relation to the regulation and authorisation of GMOs across the EU?</p>

<p>(DE) I fully and entirely understand the honourable Member’s concerns as regards genetically modified organisms (GMOs), and I can assure her that the Council shares most of these concerns. For this reason intensive discussions have been underway in the Council since December 2005 on this issue and various options have been examined as to how the European approach to GMOs could be improved. These discussions, which are being held in the ‘Environment’ and ‘Agriculture and Fisheries’ Councils, are not yet finished.</p>
<p>I would also like to draw the honourable Member’s attention to the conference on the coexistence of genetically modified, conventional and organic methods of cultivation organised in Vienna in April this year (by the Presidency and the Commission). The long-term goal here is to guarantee freedom of choice between these different methods of cultivation. The encouraging results achieved at the conference were incorporated in the Council conclusions for May, in which the next steps towards coexistence of cultivation methods are presented.</p>
<p>In April the EU Presidency also held another conference, this time on the precautionary principle in GMO policy. This event showed that there is broad consensus among the participants on the importance of this principle in the European legal framework on GMOs.</p>
<p>On 15 May the Commission presented to the European Parliament and the Council its first report on the implementation of Regulation 1830/2003 on the traceability and labelling of genetically modified organisms. Further reports on the implementation of Directive 2001/18/EC and Regulation (EC) No 1829/2003 will shortly be presented. As the honourable Member is certainly aware, these instruments constitute the EU’s new legal framework for GMOs.</p>
<p>The Council will examine this report carefully.</p>

<p>(DE) As the honourable Member knows, the Council - in line with the commitment given at the June 2001 meeting of the European Council (Goteborg) to halt the decline in biodiversity by 2010 - has repeatedly stressed the need to preserve biodiversity. It would also highlight the efforts made by the Community and the Member States to raise the issue of invasive alien species in pan-European and international fora (in connection with the Bern Convention or the UN Convention on Biological Diversity, for example).</p>
<p>The Council is aware of the concerns regarding the spread of the grey squirrel, introduced from North America, to various parts of the EU, particularly certain regions in northern Italy, and fears that it could drive the native red squirrel away from many of its established habitats and ultimately replace it. The Habitats Directive (Council Directive 92/43/EEC) calls on Member States to ensure that 'the deliberate introduction into the wild of any species which is not native to their territory is regulated so as not to prejudice [...] the wild native fauna and flora'. However, the Directive does not contain any provisions stipulating how the spread of invasive alien species already present on a Member State's territory might be brought under control.</p>
<p>The red squirrel (Sciurus vulgaris) does not currently figure on any of the lists annexed to the Habitats Directive. Nevertheless, the honourable Member's attention is drawn to the fact that the Commission will be reviewing the Habitats Directive in 2007 with the aim of adapting it to new scientific findings. Furthermore, in its recent communication 'Halting the loss of biodiversity by 2010 - and beyond', the Commission calls for a Community strategy on invasive alien species.</p>
<p>To sum up, it should be noted that biodiversity was given high priority on the agenda for the outgoing Presidency, and that the Council will continue to devote particular attention to safeguarding biodiversity in the second half of the year.</p>

<p>(DE) It should be emphasised that it is not the role of the Council presidency to formulate legislative proposals, since this falls within the ambit of the Commission.</p>
<p>In January the Austrian Presidency announced, as part of its work programme, that it would focus particularly on the consolidation of the common agricultural policy (CAP) with a view to offering European farmers a certain degree of stability and reliability, since such consolidation seems necessary if farmers are to be able to adapt to the new rules introduced by the far-reaching CAP reforms of 2003 and 2004.</p>
<p>During its term in office, the Austrian Presidency has therefore concentrated on moving the Council’s deliberations forward on the basis of the Commission’s proposals for the extension of the reform process into new areas. As a result, the Council was able to adopt measures reforming the sugar market in February of this year and the new European rules for rice imports at the end of last month. In addition, the Council is currently studying the proposal for an amendment of the common organisation of the markets in flax and hemp.</p>
<p>Other proposals for reform of the common organisation of markets are expected for fruit and vegetables, bananas and wine. The aim of the forthcoming presidencies is to treat these matters with due priority.</p>

<p>(DE) The Community attaches great importance to the development of economic activity in rural areas, since these are one of the main components of the socio-economic structure of Europe. The strategy underlying the present shaping of the common agricultural policy, which is based on the gradual decoupling of conventional agricultural grants, takes more account of the development of rural areas and particularly of the people who live in such areas.</p>
<p>The new Regulation (EC) No 1698/2005 on support for rural development, most of the provisions of which will enter into force on 1 January 2007, provides for measures that are not necessarily connected with agricultural activity. The beneficiary of a measure is very broadly defined in Article 2(h) as ‘an operator, body or firm, whether public or private, responsible for implementing operations or receiving support’; this new strategy was chosen with a view to conserving the natural and historical heritage and supporting the continuation and development of economic activity.</p>
<p>Axis 3 of the Regulation contains measures contributing to the development of the local infrastructure and human resources in rural areas for the purpose of improving the conditions for growth and job creation in all sectors and diversifying the rural economy in the broader sense of the term. People living in rural areas receive aid for measures designed to diversify the local economy and improve the quality of life in their areas. Provision is made within this axis for measures of support for the creation and development of microenterprises and the promotion of tourism. These measures will also be accompanied by activities designed to improve the quality of life in rural areas, particularly as regards village renewal and development and the conservation and upgrading of the rural heritage.</p>
<p>Axis 2 of Regulation (EC) No 1698/2005, moreover, provides for measures to improve the environment and the countryside; support for non-productive investments is one such measure.</p>
<p>The Member States must draw up their national strategy plans on the basis of the strategic guidelines for the development of rural areas, which were approved by the Council on 20 February and contain the priority axes prescribed by the Regulation. Some of these guidelines are intended to diversify the economy in rural areas, while others are targeted at the creation of local employment and diversification capacities.</p>

<p>(DE) The Convention on the Protection of the Alps (Alpine Convention) was signed by the European Economic Community on 7 November 1991 and then ratified on 26 February 1996. It finally entered into force on 4 April 1998.</p>
<p>As the honourable Member acknowledges, the Alpine Convention and its protocols form a highly complex contractual instrument whose implementation touches on numerous policy areas.</p>
<p>As far as sustainable development is concerned, the Alpine Convention and its protocols form the framework for international efforts designed to protect the Alps as a single area spanning several countries instead of each nation protecting its own Alpine territory. The Alpine Convention and its protocols constitute a legal framework based on the ‘polluter pays’ principle and on subsidiarity, prevention and cooperation – the same foundations that underlie the policies of the European Community.</p>
<p>The Austrian Presidency included in its work programme the ratification by the European Community of the protocols on soil protection, energy and tourism and hopes that the Council will soon adopt the relevant decision. The ratification of the protocols is a building block in the structure of international environmental cooperation and is also consistent with the Sixth Community Environment Action Programme.</p>
<p>The ratification of these protocols by the European Community would highlight its efforts to promote the sustainable development of this mountainous region and would thus accelerate the implementation of European measures in areas such as soil protection, energy and tourism. The protocols will enable the European Community to enhance the protection of the environment in a sensitive area encompassing parts of several countries.</p>
<p>With regard to transport, the Austrian Presidency attaches great importance to the signing by the Community of the Protocol on the implementation of the Alpine Convention in the field of transport (Transport Protocol), since it would emphasise that the Community supports measures for the protection of the Alpine environment.</p>
<p>As far as mountain agriculture is concerned, the protocol relating to that area of activity was signed on behalf of the Community at the international conference held in Chambéry on 20 December 1994. The ratification of that protocol, which is currently being examined by the various Council bodies, dovetails with the agricultural policy of the European Community, particularly with the rural-development dimension which forms the second pillar of the common agricultural policy. The Austrian Presidency takes the view that ratification should reaffirm the commitment of the Community and send out a strong political signal; at the same time, it will serve to foster the environmental-protection process throughout a region to which Europe attaches great importance.</p>

<p>(DE) Before I deal with this question in detail, let me make a few remarks on the procedure to date:</p>
<p>Over the past two years, the Council has carefully examined the Registration, Evaluation and Authorisation of Chemicals (REACH) proposal with the aim of arriving at a solution in which the right balance was struck between the various objectives of REACH. During this process the Council maintained close contact with the European Parliament in order to achieve the greatest possible degree of convergence between the positions of the two institutions. The benefit of these contacts is clearly reflected in the political agreement on a common position which was achieved at the extraordinary meeting of the Competitiveness Council on 13 December 2005.</p>
<p>On this basis, the Council is currently compiling the final version of its Common Position along with the accompanying statement of the Council’s reasons, which will then be communicated to Parliament for its second reading. On the basis of the common ground that now exists between the two positions, the Council will endeavour to reach agreement with the European Parliament at second reading so that this important legal instrument can be adopted speedily and enter into force without delay.</p>
<p>In connection with the rapid conclusion of this matter, it is gratifying to note that, for the core element of REACH, namely the registration of 30 000 substances manufactured in or imported into the EU, both institutions have devised very similar and rational solutions.</p>
<p>The same applies to the evaluation component, where the transfer of powers to a central agency is one of the keys to the efficient functioning of the system as well as being essential to uniform EU-wide implementation.</p>
<p>The main differences between the positions undoubtedly relate to the authorisation of substances of serious concern. The authorisation system was deliberately designed by the Council in such a way that the essential protective function is guaranteed, while unnecessary red tape is avoided as far as possible.</p>

<p>Mauritania, a member of the EU-ACP Joint Parliamentary Assembly, has been undergoing democratic transition since the overthrow of President Ould Taya's dictatorial regime on 4 August 2005.</p>
<p>The Military Council has pledged to carry out the reforms required to achieve democratisation and to lead the country into free elections and has also promised to ensure that no member of the current government stands in the elections.</p>
<p>Although reforms are under way and the election timetable has been set, Mauritania is appealing to the international community, and the European Union in particular, to assist it in its transition to democracy.</p>

<p>(DE) On 30 November 2005, the European Union began consultations under Article 96 of the amended Cotonou Agreement with the Islamic Republic of Mauritania at the latter’s request. At the meeting, the Mauritanian delegation provided information on the development of the situation in Mauritania since the coup d’état of 3 August and on the Government’s programme for the transitional period. At the meeting, Mauritania gave 23 undertakings concerning adherence to democratic principles, respect for fundamental rights and freedoms and the rule of law and responsible governance.</p>
<p>In the spirit of partnership that underlies the Cotonou Agreement and in view of the undertakings given by Mauritania, the EU expressed its willingness to support the transitional process in order to ensure the quickest possible restoration of democracy and the rule of law.</p>
<p>In the intervening period, the EU has been following developments in Mauritania very closely, and in May 2006, in view of the extent to which the 23 undertakings were being fulfilled and in view of the progress made in the democratisation process, decided to conclude the consultations under Article 96 and to take appropriate measures under Article 96(2)(c) of the amended Cotonou Agreement to support the process of transition, in which recognisable progress had been made, while pressing the Government to consolidate the progress towards fulfilment of its undertakings with regard to democratisation and to lead the country without delay towards transparent and democratic parliamentary elections in November 2006 and presidential elections in March 2007.</p>
<p>The Council presidency and the Commission will regularly conduct joint reviews, the first of which will take place within the next six months. The European Union will continue to monitor the situation in Mauritania very closely. On the basis of Article 8 of the Cotonou Agreement, an intensive political dialogue will be conducted with the transitional Mauritanian Government so that it can restore democracy and the rule of law, particularly by holding free and transparent local, parliamentary, senatorial and presidential elections, and improve respect for human rights and fundamental freedoms.</p>
<p>With a view to supporting the process of transition in Mauritania, a number of institutional-assistance projects were agreed at the opening of the consultations; these projects have now been launched and include the following:</p>
<p>Election-assistance project: EUR 6m. Approved in April 2006. The EU is contributing about 75% of the budget for this project, which makes it the main donor to the UNDP trust fund.</p>
<p>Support programme for the reform of the judiciary: EUR 4m. In the context of the transition process, reform of the judiciary has become one of the Government’s political priorities. The funding decision is expected at the end of 2006.</p>
<p>Support programme for local development (decentralisation and regionalisation): EUR 6m.</p>
<p>Support programme for civil society: EUR 4.5m. The funding decision is expected in June 2006.</p>
<p>Project for the provision of institutional assistance to the public treasury for the purpose of good economic governance and reform of budgetary execution procedures: EUR 2m.</p>
<p>Support project for the media sector: EUR 2m. This project covers a review of the statutory provisions governing the press and other media as well as support for the media sector during the transitional period.</p>
<p>Support project for the reform of the transport sector: EUR 3.5m.</p>

<p>(DE) In answer to this question relating to Council meetings being open to the public, the Council would refer the honourable Member to paragraph 1 of its conclusions of 21 December 2005. This states that under the codecision procedure the Council deliberations are open to the public with regard to the presentation by the Commission of all legislative proposals which, in view of their importance, are presented orally in a Council meeting, and the ensuing debate on them; this actually means that all initial discussions of matters covered by the codecision procedure are open to the public.</p>
<p>Similarly, all of the Council's final deliberations under the codecision procedure are open to the public.</p>
<p>During the first four months of 2006, the Commission did not present orally any legislative proposals subject to the codecision procedure; consequently no initial deliberations have so far taken place in public.</p>
<p>The deliberations on matters coming under the codecision procedure, to which the honourable Member refers in his question, were neither initial deliberations or final deliberations, but interim deliberations. From January to April 2006 all of the final deliberations of the Council, which took place before the vote on 25 legal measures (including six common positions) were held in public; on four occasions the Council's deliberations on matters coming under the codecision procedure at the interim stage were also open to the public.</p>
<p>In this context, the Presidency would like to point out that it is committed to ensuring greater transparency in the Council, in accordance with the Council's conclusions of 21 December 2005. Consequently, the Presidency has proposed, among other things, that the European Council should decide that all stages of the codecision procedure should be opened to the public.</p>
<p>In addition, as the honourable Member should be aware, the Council is currently reviewing the way in which the agreed measures are working and is examining all other options to improve openness and transparency, including the possibility of an amendment to its Rules of Procedure.</p>

<p>(DE) The Council has repeatedly expressed its support for the despatch of a UN mission to Darfur. As with all other UN missions, however, the decision whether to contribute to a United Nations mission by sending troops is a matter for each Member State.</p>
<p>The EU imposed an arms embargo on the whole of Sudan, which has been in force since 1994. UN Security Council resolutions 1556 (2004) and 1591 (2005) imposed an international arms embargo relating to Darfur. By virtue of Council Common Position 2005/411/CFSP concerning restrictive measures against Sudan,<a href="#defann_11_1" name="refann_11_1"><sup>(1)</sup></a>
 the measures based on resolution 1591 (2005) were consolidated with the EU measures.</p>
<p>In the European Community, the embargo is enforced through Council Regulation (EC) No 131/2004 concerning certain restrictive measures in respect of Sudan,<a href="#defann_11_2" name="refann_11_2"><sup>(2)</sup></a>
 which is directly applicable in all Member States. Under that Regulation, the Commission and the Member States must inform each other immediately of measures taken on the basis of the Regulation and supply each other with any other relevant information at their disposal, in particular information in respect of violation and enforcement problems and judgments handed down by national courts. In addition, if the provisions of the Regulation are infringed, Member States of the EU are required to impose effective, proportionate and dissuasive sanctions and to take all necessary measures to ensure that they are applied.</p>
<p>In accordance with resolution 1591, the implementation of the United Nations’ arms embargo is monitored by a committee of the Security Council.</p>

, the British Presidency raised the issue of the alleged detention of terrorist suspects by the USA in EU Member States and the transport of such suspects through their territory in the letter of 29 November 2005 from Jack Straw to the US Secretary of State, Condoleezza Rice. However, as Javier Solana and Gijs de Vries already did during their appearances before the Temporary Committee on the alleged use of European countries by the CIA for the transport and illegal detention of prisoners, the Council must stress that it has no powers to investigate these allegations. As the honourable Member is undoubtedly aware, such investigations are currently under way in the Temporary Committee of the European Parliament and in the Council of Europe.</p>
<p>The Council would also observe that, pursuant to Article 7(2) of the Treaty on European Union, it is only on a proposal by one third of the Member States or by the Commission and after obtaining the assent of the European Parliament that the Council may determine the existence of a 'serious and persistent breach' by a Member State of the principles of liberty, democracy, respect for human rights and fundamental freedoms and the rule of law, which are mentioned in Article 6(1) of the Treaty on European Union.</p>

<p>In the last few days, the Chinese Catholic Church has appointed two bishops without the approval of Pope Benedict XVI. Despite the Vatican’s efforts to prevent the ordinations, the Chinese Church ignored the Pope’s objections. The problems stem in particular from the fact that the ‘Patriotic Catholic Association’, which runs the state church in China, does not acknowledge the Pope as the primate of the Catholic Church. Further appointments are even planned for the future, likewise without the Vatican’s approval.</p>
<p>Does the Council raise this mater, and, more particularly, the unilateral action taken by the Chinese Catholic Church, at meetings with the Chinese leadership?</p>

<p>(DE) The unhindered exercise, both in public and in private, of freedom of religion or belief is a fundamental human right and one of the key issues on which the European Union seeks progress in its dialogue with China. For this reason, freedom of religion has been high on the agenda of meetings between the EU and China, not only of those forming part of the dialogue on human rights but also of talks at the highest political level.</p>
<p>Freedom of religion has also featured prominently in the last few rounds of the human rights dialogue, most recently at the 21st round of talks in Vienna on 25 and 26 May 2006. Conduct such as the cited appointments gives the EU cause for concern, whether it relates to Tibetan Buddhism or to Catholicism. The EU has also emphasised how unfavourable an impression such conduct makes on the media and parliaments of Europe. It has also raised several specific cases of people, including well-known religious leaders, who are currently in prison for having peacefully expressed their religious or ideological convictions, and it will continue to do so.</p>
<p>At the last round of dialogue on human rights, the EU reiterated emphatically to China how important it is to fix a date for the visit by the Special Rapporteur of the United Nations on freedom of religion or belief which China announced last year. The EU will continue to press for the realisation of freedom of religion and belief in China through various channels, including the process of ratification and implementation of the International Covenant on Civil and Political Rights and the adoption of recommendations by UN bodies and in the context of special UN procedures.</p>

<p>Greece has been rocked by a mobile phone-tapping scandal. It has emerged from testimony given to the parliamentary committee of inquiry that Ericsson, the company which supplied Vodafone with its operating software, had also installed 'non-activated' eavesdropping software which, once activated, was used to intercept conversations. The fact that Ericsson had installed the eavesdropping software without being asked to do so either by Vodafone or the Greek authorities confirms allegations and press reports that the US National Security Agency (NSA), based in Maryland, demands total cooperation of companies such as those referred to above if they wish to operate in the USA as well as the possibility of access to software for surveillance operations even outside the USA.</p>
<p>Can the Council categorically deny that the NSA demands such facilities of companies operating in the EU? Can it categorically deny that the 'free' eavesdropping software, which Ericsson installed in Vodafone Greece, has also been installed in other Member States of the European Union?</p>

<p>The Council wishes to point out to the honourable Member that Article 4 of European Parliament and Council Directive 2002/58/EC concerning the processing of personal data and the protection of privacy in the electronic communications sector (Directive on privacy and electronic communications)<a href="#defann_14_1" name="refann_14_1"><sup>(1)</sup></a>
 contains the following provision: ‘The provider of a publicly available electronic communications service must take appropriate technical and organisational measures to safeguard security of its services, if necessary in conjunction with the provider of the public communications network with respect to network security. […] In case of a particular risk of a breach of the security of the network, the provider of a publicly available electronic communications service must inform the subscribers concerning such risk and, where the risk lies outside the scope of the measures to be taken by the service provider, of any possible remedies, including an indication of the likely costs involved.’ Moreover, Article 5 contains the following stipulations: ‘Member States shall ensure the confidentiality of communications and the related traffic data by means of a public communications network and publicly available electronic communications services, through national legislation. In particular, they shall prohibit listening, tapping, storage or other kinds of interception or surveillance of communications and the related traffic data by persons other than users, without the consent of the users concerned, except when legally authorised to do so …’.</p>
<p>The Directive also prescribes that, where the rights of users and subscribers are not respected, national legislation should provide for judicial remedies and that penalties should be imposed on any person, whether subject to private or public law, who fails to comply with the national measures taken under the Directive.<a href="#defann_14_2" name="refann_14_2"><sup>(2)</sup></a>

<p>The figures for recent years show that there has been a gradual fall in the rate at which the population of Europe is increasing. In the ten new Member States, the population remains constant or may even be falling, with the exception of Malta and Cyprus, the population of which is increasing, just as it also is in the 15 old Member States, mainly because of migration to those countries. In the last ten years, more than 80% of the increase in the population of Europe has been attributable to immigration. In addition, the population of Europe has aged significantly, the number of young people having fallen by 20 million over the last 26 years. A contributory factor in this respect is the large number of abortions - one every 30 seconds in Europe. Finally, it is a significant fact that the number of marriages has steadily fallen over the last 24 years in Europe, while Europeans are now marrying later in life and separating at the rate of a divorce every 33 seconds.</p>
<p>Will the Council say what measures the Member States propose to take to reduce the birth deficit and make it feasible to combine work and family life? What are the latest developments in Member States' national law regarding the provision of high-quality childcare, as emphasised in the European Equality Pact?</p>

<p>(DE) The Council shares the honourable Member’s concern about the dwindling population of Europe and subscribes to his view that countermeasures are required, not only in the Member States but ideally at the European level too. The current demographic trend is indeed a key political challenge, but at the same time I should point out that many issues relating to this development fall within the exclusive competence of the Member States, and the Community therefore has no general powers to enact European legislation in this domain. It can, however, avail itself of other important mechanisms, such as the reinvigorated Lisbon Strategy for growth and employment.</p>
<p>Demographic trends are a cross-cutting issue, and the debate that the Commission initiated in March 2005 with its Green Paper entitled ‘Confronting demographic change: a new solidarity between the generations’ must be continued at the European level. As far as the low birth rate is concerned, the Commission has concluded that many factors play a part, such as difficulties in finding initial employment, a shortage of reasonably priced living accommodation, couples starting their family later and other decisions relating to education, working life and family life. While the falling birth rate is a challenge that all of us in the European Union must face together, there is no universally applicable panacea; on the contrary, a flexible approach is required. This view was also taken by the European Parliament in its latest resolution on the subject.</p>
<p>In response to the Commission’s Green Paper, the Council conducted an exploratory debate last December, during the British Presidency, on the subject of demography and human capital. It was emphasised in the course of the debate that the desired increase in the overall employment rate could only be achieved if certain other factors were taken into account, especially the need to adopt measures that would make it easier to reconcile family and working life.</p>
<p>Only recently, at its spring meeting, the European Council emphasised the importance of fostering equality between the sexes as a key to economic growth, prosperity and competitiveness, stating that it was time to make a firm commitment at the European level to pursue policies designed to promote the employment of women while ensuring a better work-life balance in order to rise to the demographic challenge.</p>
<p>In this context, the European Council approved the European pact for gender equality, which provides for a number of measures to enhance the compatibility of family and working life. This is not simply a matter of achieving the targets for the provision of childcare facilities that were set at the Barcelona meeting of the European Council in March 2002; it also entails an improvement in the availability of care services for other dependent persons. Another important measure is the promotion of parental leave for both women and men.</p>
<p>In my view it is important that these aims have now become a standard feature of the Member States’ national reform programmes; however, since structural reforms take some time to have an impact, I cannot yet assess the extent to which progress has already been made. A more precise appraisal of the situation will not be possible until the annual evaluation report has been presented in December.</p>
<p>In order to look into ways of supporting families in particular, the presidency held a conference of high-ranking experts in February entitled ‘Demographic challenges – family needs partnership’. Against the backdrop of current demographic trends, the conference focused the political discussion on partnership within the family and partnership with the business community as conditions for a good balance between family and working life and on the role of fathers as pillars of stable family relationships.</p>
<p>Among the main findings of the conference was the recognition that a higher birth rate and higher employment rates for both mothers and fathers can only be achieved if the Member States’ family policies take account of the interests of the various generations and of both sexes. It was also emphasised that the promotion of high-quality childcare facilities which meet demand and are located close to workplaces are prerequisites for an effective family policy.</p>
<p>In addition, the conference concluded that, in the context of supporting a work-life balance, more should be done to promote equal opportunities, with special emphasis on the creation of skilled and well-paid part-time jobs. Moreover, public policies relating to the family should be formulated in consultation with all national, regional and local stakeholders, with the representative bodies of management and labour and with civil society.</p>
<p>Greater compatibility of working, private and family life is also one of the main subjects of the Communication entitled ‘A roadmap for equality between women and men, 2006-2010’, which the Commission presented in March of this year. The Commission has also announced its intention of presenting a communication on demographic trends before the end of this year; this communication would follow on from the Green Paper and, as far as I know, deal directly with the subject of your question.</p>
<p>I should like to thank you for raising this issue, because the falling birth rate in Europe is a problem which concerns us all and which must be addressed by political leaders at all levels throughout the Union.</p>

<p>2005 saw the smallest number of immigrants arriving in pateras (small boats) since 1999: 11.797 immigrants landed illegally on the Spanish coast, 24.7% less than in 2004, when the figure was 15.675.</p>
<p>The mafia organisations involved are now securing alternative routes, such as via the Canaries. Even greater collaboration on the part of the European institutions is required in view of the heavy daily pressure on Spain.</p>
<p>Could the Council provide information on the Action Plan of the Rabat EU-Africa Conference, which will for the first time bring together the migration route countries of destination, transit and origin?</p>

<p>The EU-African summit to be held in Rabat on 11 and 12 July 2006 is of particular importance given the numbers of immigrants flocking to various countries of southern Europe, including Spain.</p>
<p>The problems that cause hundreds of men, women and children to flee their countries of origin are well known: extreme poverty and despair. The new agents are also familiar: mafias.</p>
<p>This conference is a good opportunity to reflect jointly on the causes and effects, and for the EU to take practical measures to shoulder its responsibilities, whilst African governments would continue to shoulder theirs.</p>
<p>A coordinated European strategy on Africa is needed, and as far as possible the EU must promote coordination between the African countries present in Rabat, including on readmission agreements with countries of origin.</p>
<p>The dramatic situation affecting thousands of Africans requires a common European position on policy and development and a coordinated political and intelligence strategy.</p>
<p>Does the Council agree with the philosophy and measures outlined above? Is it following the programme of the African Conference which is to be held in Libya in June and possible proposals stemming from that conference?</p>

<p>(DE) A European response to the migration issues raised in these questions is currently being prepared in the framework of the Global approach to migration – priority actions focusing on Africa and the Mediterranean, adopted by the European Council in December 2005.</p>
<p>The global approach to migration is intended as part of a balanced, comprehensive and coherent strategy on migration issues to be developed in a spirit of cooperation and partnership with the countries in the targeted regions. The global approach is intended to intensify cooperation among Member States and enhance the effectiveness of their action, to develop dialogue and cooperation with African States and with our neighbours throughout the Mediterranean region and to guarantee the availability of the requisite financial resources.</p>
<p>The pursuit of the global approach, which is already under way, is now the key priority. Its progress is being constantly monitored.</p>
<p>Particular importance attaches in this context to the forthcoming EU-African Ministerial Conference on Migration, which will take place in Rabat on 10 and 11 July 2006. On the table for adoption at the conference are practical measures designed to ensure more efficient cooperation among countries of origin, transit countries and countries of destination along the migration route from Central and West Africa to Europe. Spain, France and Morocco have played a leading role in this initiative. Similar regional initiatives relating to other migration routes, such as that from East Africa to Europe, are to be launched in the near future.</p>
<p>In addition, discussions focused on migration and related issues are currently taking place between the EU and other countries under Article 13 of the Cotonou Agreement with a view to arriving, in the spirit of cooperation that prevails between the parties, at effective control of migratory flows on the basis of a common plan. The readmission and return of illegal residents are among the issues being dealt with in these discussions, as are other matters such as the question of legal migration and the integration of legal residents.</p>
<p>The global approach also demands an intensification of the essential dialogue between the European Union and Africa on migration and development in the African continent as a whole. Initial contacts have been made with a view to organising a ministerial conference where these issues, which are of great importance to both sides, will be examined.</p>
<p>With regard to the situation in the Canary Islands, the Council is fully aware of the difficulties with which Spain and Mauritania have to contend. The Union has already responded to the latest sizeable wave of illegal immigrants, most of whom have been arriving in the Canary Islands from Mauritania, by taking initiatives to provide Spain and Mauritania with technical and financial assistance.</p>
<p>These initiatives included a Frontex fact-finding mission to the Canary Islands to observe the situation on the ground. Among other requests, Frontex called for the creation of a joint investigation team comprising its own officials and national experts from the Member States to operate in the Canary Islands.</p>
<p>The Commission has also sent a technical mission to Mauritania to assess the situation there; it is currently ascertaining whether further measures, such as the creation of new capabilities or financial support, are needed in Mauritania in order to bring migration under more effective control.</p>

<p>(DE) Directive 2006/24/EC on the retention of data generated or processed in connection with the provision of publicly available electronic communications services or of public communications networks establishes a balance between the need for effective criminal prosecution and the right to privacy. Article 4 of the Directive stipulates that Member States shall adopt measures to ensure that data retained in accordance with the Directive (this means traffic data and location data in the broadest sense) are provided only to the competent national authorities in specific cases and in accordance with national law. Consequently, the laws and regulations of each Member State specify when and on what conditions (e.g. prior authorisation by a competent authority) data may be communicated to the national authorities. These national laws and regulations, however, must satisfy the necessity and proportionality requirements enshrined in the European Human Rights Convention. Data may only ever be passed on in special cases: ‘data-mining’, in other words, is out of the question.</p>
<p>The relevant national laws and regulations, particularly the obligation imposed on operators and providers to guarantee confidentiality and security of data, must be based on the Community data-protection provisions (Directives 95/46/EC and 2002/58/EC). Under these directives, the Member States must also ensure that persons who suffer loss or injury because of unlawful processing of data receive compensation. Penalties must be laid down for infringements of the provisions governing the confidentiality and security of data.</p>
<p>As for the communication of retained data to the United States for the purposes of criminal prosecution, such data are treated like any other evidence. The existing instruments on judicial assistance concluded between EU Member States and the United States (bilateral treaties) and the Agreement on Mutual Legal Assistance between the European Union and the United States of America both define the conditions in which a Member State of the EU must pass on evidence, including retained traffic data – to the national authorities of the United States.</p>
<p>As a rule, such data may only be used, subject to prior authorisation, by a competent national authority for the purpose of criminal investigations and in the framework of criminal proceedings.</p>
<p>It is up to the independent courts to establish the extent to which, in the light of all the other available evidence, the data can serve as proof.</p>

<p>(DE) The Council thanks the honourable Member for her interest in this important question.</p>
<p>The Council shares the honourable Member's view that provision should be made to ensure that consumers' rights are respected.</p>
<p>The matter raised is governed by Directive 94/47/EC of the European Parliament and the Council of 26 October 1994 on the protection of purchasers in respect of certain aspects of contracts relating to the purchase of the right to use immovable properties on a timeshare basis<a href="#defann_22_1" name="refann_22_1"><sup>(1)</sup></a>

<p>The honourable Member also refers in her question to complaints about misleading advertising and 'hard sell' sales techniques. These practices are covered by Directive 2005/29/EC concerning unfair business-to-consumer commercial practices in the internal market and amending Council Directive 84/450/EEC, Directives 97/7/EC, 98/27/EC and 2002/65/EC of the European Parliament and of the Council and Regulation (EC) No 2006/2004 of the European Parliament and of the Council (‘Unfair Commercial Practices Directive’)<a href="#defann_22_2" name="refann_22_2"><sup>(2)</sup></a>
.</p>
<p>The Member States shall adopt and publish the laws, regulations and administrative provisions necessary to comply with this Directive by 12 June 2007. They shall apply those measures by 12 December 2007.</p>
<p>The Council would ask the honourable Member again to address her question to the Commission as it is the Commission, under the Treaty, which is responsible for monitoring the application of the abovementioned Directive.</p>

<p>(DE) The negotiating framework approved by the Council on 3 October 2005 defines the principles underlying the accession negotiations with Turkey, including the possibility of suspending the negotiations.</p>
<p>Paragraph 5 of the negotiating framework makes the following stipulation: ‘In the case of a serious and persistent breach in Turkey of the principles of liberty, democracy, respect for human rights and fundamental freedoms and the rule of law on which the Union is founded, the Commission will, on its own initiative or on the request of one third of the Member States, recommend the suspension of negotiations and propose the conditions for eventual resumption’.</p>

<p>The collision of the military aircraft in the Aegean following the violation of the Athens FIR by Turkish fighters, which resulted in the loss of the Greek pilot Kostas Iliakis on 23 May 2006, highlights yet again the aggression of the militarists in Ankara, which is supported by and forms part of the imperialist plans of the USA, NATO and the EU for the Balkans, the Middle East and the wider region of Eurasia. The daily violations of Greek airspace by Turkish fighter aircraft create a serious risk that war may break out with devastating consequences for the population. In recent years, in particular, with NATO having adopted the role of supreme arbiter in the Aegean, the question arises of the partition of the Aegean. Moreover, Turkey's questioning of the sovereign rights of Greece and its aggression are related to the tacit approval and support it receives from the USA, NATO and the EU.</p>

<p>(DE) The Union regrets the latest incident, especially as it resulted in the loss of human lives. With regard to Turkey’s relations with its neighbours, and particularly with Greece, may I refer you in quite general terms to the pertinent conclusions adopted at the meetings of the European Council in Helsinki in 1999 and in Brussels in December 2004. As an acceding country, Turkey must share the values and aims of the European Union as defined in the Treaties. This implies an unequivocal commitment to good neighbourly relations and the resolution of territorial disputes in accordance with the principle of peaceful settlement of conflicts which is enshrined in the Charter of the United Nations. In this context, Turkey should investigate anything that might cause friction with its neighbours and distance itself from threats and actions that could damage good neighbourly relations and jeopardise the peaceful resolution of territorial disputes. These issues are part of the negotiating framework, constitute short-term priorities of the pre-accession partnership and are raised systematically by the EU at meetings held in the framework of its political dialogue with Turkey.</p>
<p>Against this background, the Council can assure the honourable Member that all of these matters are still being closely monitored and are being raised in discussions at every level, for the maintenance of good neighbourly relations is one of the yardsticks against which Turkey’s progress along the road to accession is measured. It goes without saying that negotiations will advance in proportion as progress is achieved in the aforementioned areas.</p>

<p>In connection with EU competition rules, there is a whole raft of legislation governing consumer rights. In practice, however, consumers are not aware of any EU action protecting them against unwarrantedly high prices for goods such as fuel or pharmaceutical products. Owing to monopolistic practices, the prices for such goods are out of proportion to their usefulness. What steps does the Commission intend to take with a view to curbing the adverse effects of monopolistic agreements on the cost of living for European citizens?</p>

<p>(EN) It is one of the core principles of the Commission’s competition policy that it will take action where there are signs that competition and consumers are being harmed by anti-competitive practices by market operators.</p>
<p>The Commission has taken several prohibition decisions under Article 81 EC to tackle restrictive agreements between pharmaceuticals companies and wholesalers aimed at impeding parallel exports. The Commission also prioritises promoting competition in innovation for patented medicines between pharmaceutical producers and encouraging inter-brand competition from generic substitutes after patent expiry. In time this should contribute to ensuring a wider choice of both patented and generic pharmaceutical products at affordable prices.</p>
<p>As concerns energy in general, the Commission has recently launched a number of case investigations into possible restrictive agreements and abuse of dominant positions in gas and electricity markets. It is clear, however, that agreements and practices can only be prohibited if there is sufficient evidence that they exist and that they are anti-competitive. Detailed analysis is required before such conclusions can be drawn.</p>
<p>As for fuels, the Commission is well aware that the price of oil, gas and other fuels has increased significantly in recent years. The ongoing sector inquiry into gas and electricity markets is intended to uncover the causes of these market developments and develop possible solutions. A preliminary report was published in February 2006 and the inquiry will be completed by the end of 2006.</p>
<p>As regards motor fuels it has so far proven difficult – at national as well as Community level - to prove the existence of anti-competitive practices between motor fuel suppliers. The market is one in which there are few suppliers selling a homogeneous product in a fully transparent market. This makes parallel behaviour by suppliers easy; however, similar prices are not alone evidence of abuse. The Commission is monitoring the situation in each Member State closely in cooperation with the national competition authorities.</p>

<p>Council Directive 1999/74/EC<a href="#defann_32_1" name="refann_32_1"><sup>(1)</sup></a>
 lays down minimum standards for the protection of laying hens. Between January and May 2004, the Commission's Food and Veterinary Office (FVO) carried out inspections on the application of that directive in six selected Member States. The FVO presented the</p>
<p>overall result of its inspections in a detailed report (DG(SANCO)/8509/2004-GR). The report shows that Member States are not complying with the directive. The FVO notes that both animal welfare and competitive conditions on the internal market are affected by that fact. The FVO has also presented separate reports on each Member State in which inspections were carried out. The report on Spain puts forward detailed criticism of Spain's failure to apply the directive in a number of respects (DG(SANCO)/7230/2004-MR Final).</p>
<p>What practical measures has the Commission take in response to the FVO's criticism of the inadequate application of the directive? Has the Commission investigated whether all Member States now apply the directive in full? In accordance with Article 10 of the directive, the Commission should have submitted a socio-economic report to the Council, not later than 1 January 2005, on the implications of the directive. Why is it that the Commission has not yet submitted this report to the Council? What measures will the Commission take in cases of non-compliance with the directive?</p>

<p>(EN) The Commission has always opened infringement proceedings in accordance with Article 226 of the Treaty against those Member States which have failed to observe the provisions of Directive 1999/74/EC. The relevant actions undertaken by the Commission in this context are as follows:</p>
<p>Until October 2005, Belgium was the only Member State which had not notified national transposition measures of the Directive. The Commission opened infringement proceedings against Belgium for non-transposition of the Directive into its national legal system.</p>
<p>The Commission opened infringement proceedings against Italy for wrong transposition of the Directive which are still ongoing. Italy has recently notified national transpositions measures which are currently being analysed by the Directorate General for Health and Consumer Protection. A decision on launching infringement proceedings also against Spain and the United Kingdom will be made on the basis of the analysis which is currently underway, and which relates to the correct application of the measures transposed by these two Member States.</p>
<p>The adoption of the Commission’s report on various systems to keep laying hens as foreseen in Article 10 of Directive 1999/74/EC is expected during summer 2006.</p>
<p>A scientific opinion from the European Food Safety Authority and a socio-economic study carried out by an external consultant are already available on the website of Directorate General for Health and Consumer Protection.</p>
<p>To ensure that the report is based on sound scientific evidence, in particular with regard to the new enriched cage systems, it was appropriate to await the results of a research project funded by the Commission and presented earlier this year.</p>

<p>(EN) Eurobarometer indicates that the attitude of consumers towards biotechnology varies between applications and between Member States.</p>
<p>While there are still resistances in some Member States towards the use of GM technology in the food sector, there are no such reactions in other fields where similar techniques are commonly used. For instance, the Commission is not aware of any negative attitude towards the use of biotech industrial processes in the production of enzymatic products or for medicines, vaccines or therapies.</p>
<p>In relation to the negative attitude of some consumers, the Commission main competence is to make sure that genetically modified organisms (GMOs) authorised in the EU are science-based, safe and that consumers have a real possibility to choose between GM and non GM products. Both objectives are actively pursued by the existing EU regulatory framework.</p>
<p>The Commission would like to point out, in addition, that on 12 April 2006 it dedicated an orientation debate to the issue of improving confidence in the risk assessment procedures linked to GMOs with the broader objective of reaching a better common understanding of the related issues. Following that debate the Commission decided to ask EFSA<a href="#defann_34_1" name="refann_34_1"><sup>(1)</sup></a>
 to: (i) liaise more fully with national scientific bodies as a means to resolve diverging scientific opinions with Member States; (ii) provide more detailed justifications, in its opinion on individual applications, for not accepting scientific objections raised by national competent authorities; (iii) clarify which scientific protocols should be used by applicants to carry out scientific studies demonstrating safety. In the same conclusions, the Commission identified the need to address more explicitly potential long term effects and bio-diversity issues, and the need to introduce, on a case by case basis and where specific risks are identified, additional proportionate risk-management measures in its draft decisions to place GMOs on the market.</p>
<p>The Commission would also like to recall its efforts to promote research and information in this sector via specific projects approved in the context of the Framework Programmes for Research and Technological Development.</p>
<p>Under this project, comprehensive information sources on GMOs were established. A specific website was realised with the contribution of independent scientists aiming at providing consumers with balanced information on GMOs, including assessment procedures and authorisation status for GM crops in the EU.</p>

<p>(EN) The Commission notes carefully the Court judgement in the Watts case delivered on 16 May 2006.</p>
<p>This decision is consistent with the Court’s previous case-law on patient mobility and confirms principles already established by earlier decisions, for example in Kohll; Smits and Peerbooms; or Müller-Fauré.</p>
<p>The Court reiterated the principles regarding patients’ right to receive medical treatment in other Member State and be reimbursed for that treatment.</p>
<p>Most importantly, the Court confirms that the fact that reimbursement is sought from a publicly funded national health service, such as the UK’s National Health Service, does not mean that the Treaty rules on the freedom to provide services do not apply.</p>
<p>It also confirms the right of patients facing in their Member State waiting times exceeding a medically acceptable period having regard to the medical condition and clinical needs of the person concerned to be authorised to receive treatment abroad.</p>
<p>The Commission will take the appropriate steps in order to ensure that Member States comply with the evolving jurisprudence of the Court and will, in particular, address individual complaints from European citizens.</p>
<p>When health services were excluded from the scope of the proposed Directive on services in the Internal Market, the Commission made clear that this does not take away the necessity to address the increasing jurisprudence of the Court in regard to patient mobility. It said that it will come back to those issues in the future. The President of the Commission has asked Commissioners in charge of Health and Consumer Protection, Internal Market and Services and Employment to develop proposals on these issues.</p>
<p>The Commission already indicated in its Annual Policy Strategy for 2007 that it will develop a Community framework for safe, high quality and efficient health services, by reinforcing cooperation between Member States and providing clarity and certainty over the application of Community law to health services and healthcare.</p>
<p>The Council and the Parliament will also soon discuss the Commission proposal of implementing Regulation of the Regulation 883/04, dealing with coordination of social security scheme of the Member States. Some practical issues related to the case law of the Court are dealt with by some provisions in the context of the sickness benefits chapter.</p>
<p>Given the sensitivity and complexity of this issue, the Commission will of course involve all interested parties in the discussion on any future proposals. Proper consultation of broad range of stakeholders is vital for success of any initiative in this field.</p>

<p>States which have recently acceded to the European Union, such as Lithuania, are involved in development cooperation activities. For countries which not long ago were still receiving aid themselves, this is a completely new field of external policy. Managing development cooperation policy requires very specific know-how and skills, including a knowledge of the methods of implementing this policy and its technical aspects. Newcomers to the EU badly need the support of the old Member States as regards specific experience and training in fields related to the planning, implementation and assessment of development cooperation policy. Hitherto, such specialised direct assistance from the Commission has been lacking, although the new Member States have informed the relevant departments of their needs.</p>
<p>What practical measures will the Commission take to help the new EU Member States to participate fully in development cooperation policy? What share of the Community budget will be allocated to such measures? How will the proposed measures be implemented?</p>

<p>(FR) Firstly, the new Member States have received pre-accession grants designed, among other things, to strengthen the public administration of these countries in different areas including development cooperation. Significant sums have been made available even after accession to enable the 10 countries to propose ‘Twinning’ or ‘Twinning Light’ projects for the provision of training for their staff through quality technical assistance. Hungary and Slovakia have applied for these grants.</p>
<p>Likewise, it should be noted that after accession (1 May 2004 or later in the case of Romania and Bulgaria) specific funds, grouped together in a Transition Facility, are made available to the new Member States and this is for a limited period in order to be able to continue with the development of their administrative and judicial capacity which was started within the framework of the pre-accession funds.</p>
<p>From 2003, the authorities responsible for development policy in the new Member States have been invited to take part in the political dialogue with the Commission and the Member States on a permanent basis.</p>
<p>Furthermore, the Commission regularly reviews the needs of the new Member States as well as the acceding countries and candidate countries and informs those countries about the support operations implemented by the Commission as well as by other countries in the European Union. A working party in which most of the old and new Member States participate, as well as acceding countries and candidate countries, has been meeting at least twice monthly since 2003.</p>
<p>In more concrete terms, the Commission has reserved, for the officials of the new Member States, a limited number of places on specialised courses organised by the Commission (EuropeAid) for its staff. Furthermore, technical assistance has been made available in 2005 for a sum of EUR 200 000 for the purpose of organising training courses, seminars, conferences or specific technical assistance to meet the expressed needs of these countries. A second phase of this project is planned for 2006.</p>
<p>Training activities are provided free through EuropeAid and other ad hoc budget lines have so far made it possible to finance specific support activities insofar as the objective of the budget line was the coordination of the Member States’ policies for the benefit of developing countries.</p>
<p>The implementation of the activities set up by the Commission is described in detail in the annual report which the Commission draws up every year on development policy. Moreover, the Commissioner in charge of development has had the opportunity to explain what the Commission does and how it does it during his visits to some of the new Member States last year.</p>
<p>The implementation of the above-mentioned measures is achieved through constant dialogue with the responsible officials in the new Member States, the acceding countries and the candidate countries. The courses organised by EuropeAid and the activities financed by the Directorate-General for Development are implemented through a ‘based on demand’ system, taking into account the needs presented by the new Member States.</p>

<p>(EN) The EU has made major progress in reconciling the migration policy agenda and the development policy agenda. Only a few years back these were different worlds, far apart. Today there is a broad consensus – reflected in numerous EU Council Conclusions – that migration is part and parcel of the development process, and that development policy is an essential component of any migration policy.</p>
<p>Following this inclusive approach the EU has agreed on a broad and balanced agenda of dialogue and action with developing countries. For us, the external dimension of migration policy includes topics such as:</p>
<p>Addressing the root causes of (forced) migration;</p>
<p>Turning brain drain into ‘brain gain’ (through circular migration and return programmes);</p>
<p>Linking migrant diasporas and their remittances to the national development processes of the countries of origin;</p>
<p>Effectively integrating legal migrants in countries of destination;</p>
<p>Strengthening migration management capacities in countries of origin and transit, in view of better addressing illegal migration flows;</p>
<p>Fighting trafficking of human beings;</p>
<p>Supporting refugees and strengthening regional protection capacities.</p>
<p>Turning these objectives into concrete programmes and actions is one of the major challenges in the current 10<span class="sup">th</span>
 European Development Fund programming exercise. In dialogue, cooperation and partnership with ACP<a href="#defann_38_1" name="refann_38_1"><sup>(1)</sup></a>
 countries we will now effectively integrate the migration dimension into our development programmes.</p>
<p>On the specific topic of fighting illegal migration, the Commission has already taken urgent action. Projects have been financed in various regions of the world, in particular for the improvement of border management. A project financed under the AENEAS<a href="#defann_38_2" name="refann_38_2"><sup>(2)</sup></a>
 programme has started focussing on joint patrolling between Spanish and Moroccan authorities, Cap Verde, Mauritania and Senegal are associated with the project.</p>
<p>In March 2006, as an immediate response to the crisis in the Canary Islands, Commissioner in charge of External Relations indicated that up to €2 million could be made available under the Rapid Reaction Mechanism (RRM) to assist Mauritania in dealing with the flow of migrants now travelling from its coastline.</p>
<p>The Commission has been working closely with Spanish and Mauritanian officials to identify concrete measures that could usefully be taken to address this serious situation. These measures include an improved maritime patrolling and search and rescue capacity, and support in the treatment of returnees from Spain and those found at sea, or stranded at the internal borders, with assistance for their care and repatriation, in line with international law and convention for voluntary return. A formal decision on RRM financing will be taken imminently.</p>
<p>In addition, the possibilities of intensified maritime control with the involvement of various EU Member States and coordinated by the European External Border Agency (FRONTEX) is being actively explored. On 24 May, the Vice-President of the Commission in charge of Justice, Freedom and Security discussed the package of EU support with Spanish Vice-President Fernández de la Vega, expressing the commitment of the Commission to assist Spain in addressing the crisis.</p>
<p>Commissioner in charge of Development and Humanitarian Help met on June 8<span class="sup">th</span>
 with the President of the Canary Islands to explore ways of collaborating in development cooperation, and thus in fighting illegal immigration.</p>
<p>Finally, concerning the AENEAS programme, the relevant Regulation<a href="#defann_38_3" name="refann_38_3"><sup>(3)</sup></a>
 stipulates that "The programme is particularly, but not exclusively, intended for those third countries actively engaged in or preparing or implementing a readmission agreement initialled, signed or concluded with the European Community." This was a priority in the call for proposals for 2004, 2005 and 2006. In 2004 two projects were selected, one focussing on Albania and one on Macao. The evaluation of the 2005 Call for Proposals is still ongoing and the results are not known yet.</p>

<p>Migration flows from sub-Saharan Africa to the EU are increasing daily. Spain, like Italy and Greece, has a geographical situation that makes it a natural point of entry to the EU as well as an external border, and the number of people arriving in the Canary Islands is reaching a level which requires rational planning of these flows and methods of dealing with them on a European scale.</p>
<p>In view of the dramatic situation, will the Commission propose specific budgetary measures to meet this challenge? Would it be possible to use the EDF, which is not actually a Community fund, or development aid, or even the stability instrument?

<p>(EN) The Commission is fully aware of the growing importance of illegal migration flows originating from African countries towards Europe. This phenomenon has been dramatically illustrated by recent events, with thousands of illegal migrants leaving the Mauritanian and Senegalese coasts towards the Canary Islands, many of them losing their lives during these attempts.</p>
<p>From the onset of the crisis, the Commission has recognised the need to react promptly to the situation and stressed that this is a clear case for European solidarity. The Commission has been in permanent contact with the Spanish authorities in charge of migration in order to coordinate their respective responses.</p>
<p>As an immediate reaction to the crisis, the Commissioner in charge of External Relations decided that an amount up to of €2 million from the Rapid Reaction Mechanism (RRM) should be used to reinforce the capability of Mauritania to deal with migratory flows and in particular to provide assistance to migrants in accordance to international standards. After a fact finding mission to Mauritania, a Financing Proposal was prepared and should be approved in June 2006.</p>
<p>As a further step, it was decided to convene meetings between the EU and Sub-Saharan countries of origin and/or transit for migration in the context of Article 13 of the Cotonou Agreement. The first series of meetings led by the local Presidencies of the EU was held from 23 to 25 May 2006 when a delegation of the Commission visited Mauritania and Senegal. This dialogue will be extended to two other levels: pan-African (with the AU<a href="#defann_39_1" name="refann_39_1"><sup>(1)</sup></a>
) and regional (with ECOWAS<a href="#defann_39_2" name="refann_39_2"><sup>(2)</sup></a>
). The regional dimension of the dialogue should be particularly useful when discussing migration routes globally.</p>
<p>The Commission will use the information collected and the conclusions of the dialogue held with the different countries, regional organisations and the AU in the context of the forthcoming programming exercise of the 10<span class="sup">th</span>
 European Development Fund (10th EDF). It is expected that the overall "migration and development" theme will become part of the programming dialogue both at (sub) regional level and with targeted countries. Specific projects may be funded under the Regional Indicative Programmes (RIP) and the National Indicative Programmes (NIP), provided they respond to needs identified during the process of dialogue and can produce clearly identifiable results.</p>
<p>Furthermore, a new regional instrument, the Intra-ACP<a href="#defann_39_3" name="refann_39_3"><sup>(3)</sup></a>
 Migration Capacity Building Facility, still funded under the 9<span class="sup">th</span>
 EDF, will be operational in 2007 for national actions with a (sub) regional dimension, implemented in cooperation with other ACP countries.</p>
<p>The thematic programme on asylum and migration in relations with third countries (so called 'AENEAS programme') is also currently available to fund actions in relation to migration flows from sub-Saharan Africa. The AENEAS programme covers the full range of activities to build capacity of third countries on migration and asylum issues. The programme certainly tries to find responses to the challenges posed by migration flows towards the EU, but it also addresses the issues of migration and development or protection of refugees in certain regions. One of the advantages of this thematic programme is to overcome the geographical limitations of the EDF or the MEDA<a href="#defann_39_4" name="refann_39_4"><sup>(4)</sup></a>
 programme. Concretely, the programme can facilitate cooperation along a migration route (e.g. Mali/ Senegal – Mauritania – Spain) which is particularly relevant for the current situation. The programme is implemented through annual Call for proposals. The Call for Proposals 2005 is being evaluated at the moment and the Call for Proposals 2006 will be launched during summer 2006.</p>
<p>With regard to the future<a href="#defann_39_5" name="refann_39_5"><sup>(5)</sup></a>
:</p>
<p>a) as said above, migration will be integrated into the regular country programming for all regions, including under the 10<span class="sup">th</span>
 EDF, as appropriate,</p>
<p>b) a new thematic programme on migration and asylum is currently being prepared to succeed to the 'AENEAS programme'.</p>

<p>The Commission agrees that the conference will provide a useful opportunity to reflect jointly on the causes and consequences of migratory flows, including irregular flows, and at ways in which the challenges related to migration could be addressed jointly by countries of origin, transit and destination, in a spirit of partnership and complying with the European Consensus for Development. In this respect, the Commission hopes that the Conference will come up with recommendations that are sufficiently concrete on how to make such partnership a reality. These recommendations can then be used by the EC – but also by Member States and other participants – as a source of inspiration for devising concrete measures to help our partners improve their capacity to manage migration flows, to deal with the challenges of migration, be it to tackle human trafficking and smuggling networks or to maximise the benefits of legal, orderly migration flows for development, and – in general – to strengthen the positive synergies between migration and development, where they exist.</p>
<p>The Commission would also like to stress that, over the longer term, the recently adopted Africa Strategy, which includes an important section on migration, constitutes the basic framework to address the root causes of migration by contributing to Africa’s development.</p>
<p>The legal framework of our cooperation with ACP<a href="#defann_40_1" name="refann_40_1"><sup>(1)</sup></a>
 countries is provided by the Cotonou Agreement, which talks – in its Art. 13 – also about cooperation in the area of migration. Article 13 contains, inter alia, a standard readmission clause.</p>
<p>The Commission is currently developing, as requested by the European Council in December 2005, a dialogue based on article 13 with a number of priority countries, notably in Western Africa. This dialogue will look, among other issues, at the effective implementation of the readmission obligation provided for in Art. 13. The Commission would like to note that Art. 13 also provides for the possibility of financial support from the EU to ACP countries to help them discharge their readmission obligations.</p>
<p>The Commission however believes that the dialogues under Art. 13 could usefully be supplemented by bilateral contacts between interested individual Member States and the countries in question. The Commission would also like to recall that Art. 13 also includes a general commitment to negotiate readmission agreements, if requested by one of the Parties. In this context ‘Parties’ also refers to individual Member States. Art. 13 therefore offers each EU Member State a basis on which to seek the negotiation of a bilateral readmission agreement with a given ACP country should this country wish to go beyond the provisions of the readmission clause.</p>

How will the European Commission assure sufficient attention for sustainable human and social development within the 10th EDF? More specifically, how much will the EU allocate to the fight against HIV/AIDS and its structural determinants (i.e. social exclusion, weak health systems, no access to primary education, and so on) within the 10th EDF, considering the EDF's poor track record on spending in the social sector at country level?</p>

<p>(EN) The contribution of the EC to the fight against Human immunodeficiency virus/Acquired immunodeficiency syndrome (HIV/AIDS) cannot and should not be measured only in financial terms. Through its policy and advocacy work, the Commission has strongly supported over the years the HIV/AIDS agenda at both the country and global level. In the past, the Commission has worked quite intensively with Council and Parliament to strengthen the European’s voice in the fight against HIV/AIDS globally as well as within the EU and in the neighbouring countries.</p>
<p>More specifically, the European Union has adopted in 2004 a comprehensive and strategic policy framework and in 2005 a programme for action to confront HIV/AIDS, malaria and tuberculosis and reiterated the priority it attaches to confronting theses diseases, including their structural determinants the honourable Member refers to, in the European Consensus on Development, in the Africa strategy and the strategies for the Caribbean and the Pacific. The Commission’s Communication on combating HIV/AIDS within the EU and in the neighbouring countries adopted in 2005 sets the priority areas for actions for this geographical area until the end of 2009. The external actions proposed are fully in line and complementary to the overall policy framework for EC external action on HIV/AIDS, malaria, and tuberculosis.</p>
<p>The funding 2007-2013 will come from two sources: 1) the EU budget in the form of country programming for several world regions and thematic programming and 2) the 10<span class="sup">th</span>
 European Development Fund (EDF) in case of the ACP<a href="#defann_41_1" name="refann_41_1"><sup>(1)</sup></a>
 countries. Country programming is driven by country ownership and priorities and therefore it is not for the Commission to allocate funding on its own. The Commission through the above policies, global advocacy, policy dialogue and programming reviews, but also guidelines for Delegations, is doing all it can to help partner countries address the fight against HIV/AIDS and other diseases, to improve their health systems and access to primary education. But ultimately, it is for the partner countries themselves to define the priorities of their development and poverty reduction strategies.</p>
<p>Furthermore, the EC contributions to the Global Fund to fight HIV/AIDS, malaria and tuberculosis (GFATM) and the future funding from the thematic programme, to be adopted as part of the Development Cooperation and Economic Cooperation Instrument (DCECI), will ensure a predictable funding from the Commission for the period 2007-2013. Between 2002 and 2005, the EC has provided financial support to the GFATM for a total of €432,5 million, which corresponds to an annual average of over €100 million. In 2006, the EC will contribute €90 million to the GFATM. The President of the Commission has recently announced his intention to make a pledge for the 2007 contribution to the GFATM and has confirmed that in 2007 the EC intends to keep at least the same level of funding of previous years. The contribution to be proposed would probably have to be divided on an annual basis between the 10<span class="sup">th</span>
 EDF Intra-ACP Funds and the DCECI as this is the only way to reach this level of funding provided all parties can agree. The past contributions were sourced in a similar way between the 9<span class="sup">th</span>
 EDF and the EU budget (under the budget line the honourable Member refers to).</p>
<p>The GFATM has proven over the years to be the biggest financing mechanism and public-private partnership to confront HIV/AIDS, tuberculosis and malaria in more than 130 countries worldwide.</p>
<p>The thematic programme is intended to continue financing the same priorities as the current budget line based on Regulation 1568/2003 while also addressing other priorities in a holistic way such as those mentioned by the honourable Member: social exclusion, health systems, primary education and others.</p>
<p>But as the honourable Member knows, neither the legal base nor the precise budget allocations have been decided upon yet.</p>

<p>(EN) Achieving gender equality and closing the gender gap in education is a priority in the EC development policy in education. The EC policy is anchored on the education Millennium Development Goals (MDG) – gender parity in school education by 2005 and universal primary education by 2015 - and the six Education for All Goals by 2015. The latter cover most levels of education, from early childhood care to secondary education as well as adult literacy and put special emphasis on gender equality.</p>
<p>It must be noted that the first MDG target of gender parity in school education by 2005 has been missed. More effort on the part of partner countries and donors alike is required to help girls access and remain in the school system.</p>
<p>The EC is increasingly working through sector approaches and general budget support to support partner governments in their effort to implement nationally owned plans. In this context, the EC addresses gender equality concerns in the education sector dialogue with the partner country. The sector dialogue, with government in the driving seat, involves civil society partners, e.g. women’s organisations, thus providing a broad-based platform for education dialogue.</p>
<p>Issues pertinent to the dialogue are identified and assessed in the drafting process the Country Strategy Papers and the annual reviews of EC cooperation. The analysis assesses the situation in education in the respective partner country in terms of trends, progress or delays towards the education MDGs and in terms of policies and commitments to reforms. Particular attention is given to assessing access to services by disadvantaged and vulnerable groups, and by women and girls in particular.</p>
<p>Progress in education is monitored first of all in the context of MDG indicators, which include indicators on gender balance at different levels of education. These are reported on annually in the framework of the reviews stipulated in the Cotonou Agreement for the ACP<a href="#defann_42_1" name="refann_42_1"><sup>(1)</sup></a>
 countries. Secondly, education outcome indicators are included in education sector budget support operations and in most general budget support operations. These have variable tranches, the release of which is triggered on the progress made towards targets set by the partner country. In case of deficient progress, the variable tranche amount is diminished.</p>
<p>In the context of the on-going political dialogue between the partner country and the Commission any non-respect of government commitments is reviewed and analysed and appropriate means identified to assist the government to achieve its targets.</p>

<p>The Commission has – correctly – attributed the deadlock in the Doha Round negotiations within the World Trade Organisation to a lack of flexibility on the part of non-EU industrialised States and the emerging economies. The Commission considers the conditional offer of October 2005, including the agricultural sector, to be credible and significant. Moreover, while leading third-country trading partners continue to be intransigent in their positions, the EU continues to come under pressure to make further unilateral concessions in the agricultural sector.</p>
<p>Are reports that a new offer in the agricultural sector is to be made in order to take the negotiations forward correct? Does the Commission intend to ask the Council for a new negotiating mandate?

<p>(EN) The Commissioner in charge of Trade has repeated at several occasions in recent weeks that there is a window of opportunity for unlocking the Doha Development Agenda (DDA). The condition is that World Trade Organisation (WTO) Members in a position to do so must make meaningful offers in all parts of the negotiation.</p>
<p>In particular, he has said that the United States (US) should offer a substantial and real reduction in trade distorting farm support. The US should also discipline the most distortive individual farm support programmes. At the same time, the advanced developing countries, such as Brazil, India, China or Chile, should offer cuts in their applied tariffs for industrial products.</p>
<p>The EU would have to make a contribution as well. The EU is prepared to enhance further its current agricultural offer within the limits of the 2003 Common Agricultural Policy reform if key partners put something worthwhile on the table along the lines that have just been described.</p>
<p>The Commission is working hard to convince its negotiating partners to create the right conditions for reaching a deal on key DDA modalities by summer 2006.</p>
<p>The Commission is aware of the idea, put forward by President Lula, of convening a Heads of State meeting on the DDA. It is an interesting idea which deserves serious consideration. However, at this stage, our focus should remain on the regular WTO proceedings. On April 2006, it was agreed by all Members to have intensive negotiations in Geneva, in view of agreement on modalities by Ministers by summer 2006.</p>

<p>(EN) Traditional games and sports are practised in many European regions and can be found in every EU Member State. These types of activities are therefore part of a diverse European cultural heritage. They should also feed into the Commission’s overall approach to sport, because of their social, cultural and educational character and values.</p>
<p>The Commission follows with interest the initiatives in the field of physical education and sport at United Nations Educational, Scientific and Cultural Organization (UNESCO) level, that aim at promoting, encouraging and developing traditional sports and games worldwide. The Commission takes note of the efforts by CIGEPS<a href="#defann_45_1" name="refann_45_1"><sup>(1)</sup></a>

<p>However, the Commission considers that drawing up a specific annual programme to promote regional and traditional sporting events in Europe is not a suitable option in a policy area, such as sport, where the EU currently has no direct competence.</p>
<p>The Commission intends to launch a White Paper on Sport in 2007 that will look inter alia into the societal dimension of sport. The promotion of traditional games and sports could be addressed in the White Paper as part of the reflections on the social, cultural and citizenship functions of sport.</p>
<p>This would then be another opportunity to follow-up on the Parliament’s Recommendation of 1994<a href="#defann_45_3" name="refann_45_3"><sup>(3)</sup></a>
 to promote regional and traditional sports in Europe.</p>

<p>(EN) The honourable Member refers to the Danish rules on medical benefits which provide that patients may obtain government contributions towards medicines purchased at a Danish pharmacy only.</p>
<p>Since the issue appears to concern a general legislative measure of the Danish Government, it does not seem to be relevant for the application of competition rules or State aid provisions.</p>
<p>Instead, the question relates to the application of the free movement of goods principle and the freedom to provide and receive services principle taking into account that each Member State is free to determine the details of its national social security system, such as who is to be insured under its legislation, which benefits are granted and under what conditions, and under what circumstances prescription costs should be reimbursed. In this respect, Community law does not detract from the powers of Member States to organise their social security systems and to adopt, in particular, provisions intended to govern the consumption of pharmaceutical preparations in order to promote the financial stability of their health-care insurance schemes.</p>
<p>However, national provisions concerning the national security system must not contravene EC law. While the Danish rules allegedly refuse the reimbursement of the costs of medicines purchased in another Member State, they encourage insured persons in Denmark to purchase those products in Denmark rather than in other Member States and are thus liable to curb the import of those products legally manufactured and marketed in those States. Such rules are normally categorised as a barrier to the free movement of goods contrary to Article 28 of the EC Treaty, unless justified on grounds of general public interest under Article 30 of the EC Treaty.</p>
<p>It is also notable that Regulation (EEC) No 1408/71 on the application of social security schemes to employed persons, to self-employed persons and to members of their families moving within the Community, establishes common rules and principles, such as non-discrimination on the basis of nationality, which have to be observed when applying national social security rules. This ensures that the application of the different national legislations does not adversely affect persons exercising their right to free movement within the European Union.</p>

<p>(EN) The honourable Member will be aware that responsibility for the organisation and content of the education and training systems rests with each Member State, as laid down in Article 149 of the Treaty establishing the European Community. However, the Commission shares the view that students and teachers should know more about the European Union. The latest joint report of the Council and the Commission on the progress of the Education and Training 2010 work programme<a href="#defann_48_1" name="refann_48_1"><sup>(1)</sup></a>
 reveals that the knowledge that young people need as European citizens remains a major challenge.</p>
<p>There are a number of practical ways in which the Commission complements the work of Member States in this field.</p>
<p>The Commission’s proposal for a Recommendation of the Parliament and the Council on key competences for lifelong learning<a href="#defann_48_2" name="refann_48_2"><sup>(2)</sup></a>
 identifies and defines the competences that should be developed during initial education and training by all citizens living in a knowledge-society; the European dimension is a key element of the Social and Civic competence and of Cultural awareness.</p>
<p>Furthermore, Community education and training programmes such as Socrates and Leonardo da Vinci have for over a decade given schools the possibility to get involved in school partnerships and other projects which help foster knowledge of other European countries and of the European Union. Similarly, Spring Day for Europe (organised in cooperation with European Schoolnet<a href="#defann_48_3" name="refann_48_3"><sup>(3)</sup></a>
) promotes knowledge about the European Union and the workings of its Institutions, with the aim of establishing a dialogue about visions of Europe and its future between pupils, teachers and others in the EU.</p>
<p>Finally, the White Paper on a European Communication Policy<a href="#defann_48_4" name="refann_48_4"><sup>(4)</sup></a>
 proposes as a way to “empower the citizens” that the EU could help to ensure exchange of best practise and facilitate the development of common educational “tools” so that the European dimension is reflected more effectively. The creation of a European network of teachers is mentioned as an example with a view to exchanging ideas on innovative approaches to civic education and to learn new skills.</p>

<p>At the beginning 2005, there were 1 350 000 illegal foreigners in Spain. On 7 May 2005, Spain concluded a mass regularisation of immigrants, a process which has had extremely serious consequences for Europe. The process culminated with 577 049 illegal immigrants being regularised; a year later, according to figures supplied by NGOs, there are once again 1 350 000 illegal immigrants in Spain, i.e. the regularisation process has attracted a thresh 600 000 immigrants into the country as a result of the 'efecto llamada' ('pull factor'').</p>
<p>Is the Commission aware of the need to establish Community mechanisms for supervising and even controlling national regularisation of immigrants, because such processes affect all the Member Sates?

<p>(EN) As a general rule, the Commission does not comment on actions taken by the Member States within the sphere of their competencies. Regularising illegally staying immigrants is precisely one of these competencies since there is currently no Community legislation that regulates the way in which Member States should deal with the presence of high numbers of illegally staying third country nationals on their territories.</p>
<p>The Commission is aware that national measures taken by one Member State in the area of immigration, including large-scale regularisations, may have effects on other Member States. It is for this reason that, in February 2005, the Commission and the then Luxemburg Presidency proposed to the Justice and Home Affairs Ministers to establish a mutual information system on all national measures that may have an impact on the other Member States. This initiative led to the adoption, on 14 April 2005, of Council conclusions in which the Commission was invited to come forward with a legislative proposal to formalise such a system.</p>
<p>On 10 October 2005, the Commission presented the requested proposal for a Council Decision on the establishment of a mutual information procedure on the measures of the Member States in the areas of asylum and immigration<a href="#defann_49_1" name="refann_49_1"><sup>(1)</sup></a>
. The basic idea of this proposal is that the Member States should inform each other – and the Commission – as soon as possible on the measures which they intend to adopt or which they recently adopted and which may have a significant impact on the other Member States. The possibility to organise an exchange of views among experts from the Member States and the Commission on such national measures was also proposed.</p>
<p>On 1 June 2006, the Justice and Home Affairs Council reached political agreement on this proposal and its formal adoption should take place once the Parliament will have rendered its opinion. The text endorsed by the Council keeps all of the essential elements of the Commission's proposal. The Commission hopes that the Council Decision, once applicable, will lead to a better information and co-ordination between Member States in the area of migration and asylum.</p>
<p>Finally, the Commission wishes to inform the honourable Member that it is currently preparing a Communication on the future priorities in the area of illegal immigration. At the same time, it is putting into practice the conclusions of the European Council of December 2005, which decided to take a series of priority measures related to the migratory phenomena in Africa and the Mediterranean to reduce illegal migration flows and the loss of lives. These priority measures aim to ensure safe returns of illegal immigrants, strengthen durable solutions for refugees and build capacity to better manage migration, including through maximising the benefits to all partners of legal migration, while fully respecting human rights and the right to seek asylum.</p>

<p>(EN) On 21 and 22 May 2006, the Vice-President of the Commission in charge of Justice, Freedom and Security travelled to Libya and met with Colonel Khaddafi and a number of Government officials.</p>
<p>On that occasion, Libya has indicated that, although it is strongly committed to developing its relations with the EU, it is not ready to join the Barcelona process.

 and interested Member States, to Libya's Southern border with a view to examining how Libya could be supported in its efforts to control that border and prevent loss of life in the desert. Libya has welcomed this proposal and a date for that mission is expected to be agreed soon.</p>
<p>The Commission will continue its effort to deepen the dialogue on migration and related issues with Libya and is confident that more ambitious and structured cooperation can be developed over the medium-term.</p>

<p>Given that, under the common agricultural policy, provisions for single farm payments for 2005 were available to national governments for payment to farmers by December 2005, and given that significant monies due to farmers from England will only have been claimed well after that date, it is fair to assume that such large unclaimed funds must have been accruing considerable interest within the EU budget in the meantime.</p>

<p>The development of transport infrastructure is a key challenge in the European Union. The European Union is responding by supporting the trans-European networks. Developing the Danube to make it a European waterway will play a crucial role in this context. In Germany, the last bottleneck for shipping on the Danube between Straubing and Vilshofen is to be removed. What is the Commission's assessment of the impact on the flow of traffic, particularly to south-east Europe, if the Danube is developed along the lines of option C2,80?

<p>(EN) The stretch between Straubing and Vilshofen forms part of the inland waterway axis Rhine/Meuse-Main-Danube, which is one of the 30 Priority axes defined in Annex III of the Decision of the Parliament and of the Council, on the revision of the TEN-T Guidelines<a href="#defann_52_1" name="refann_52_1"><sup>(1)</sup></a>
.</p>
<p>According to this Decision, a project must be completed by 2013 in order to remove the serious navigability bottlenecks on this stretch. The Commission has followed the recent developments in the spatial planning procedure (Raumordnungsverfahren) with great interest. The Commission has been briefed shortly after the decision of the Government of Niederbayern, which suggest that the more appropriate solution is the variant C2,80. This variant, which ensures the necessary depth for navigability for almost 290 days per year, constitutes undoubtedly a great improvement compared with the existing situation.</p>
<p>Similar projects to improve navigability and remove bottlenecks are planned on other parts of the Danube in Austria, Slovakia, Hungary, Romania and Bulgaria. Ideally all projects should lead to a situation where the necessary depth of 2.5 m is ensured for the largest possible part of the year.</p>
<p>The Commission will examine in detail the project in Vilshofen-Straubing, including also all environmental aspects, once it receives an official request for funding from the German Government. According to its information, the Federal Government and the Government of Niederbayern are still examining the project in order to take a final decision concerning the variant to be implemented.</p>

<p>(EN) The Commission would like to underline the efforts and progress made in this field both by the Parliament (in particular the successful “Declaration on tackling racism in football”) and by the football family.</p>
<p>In the run-up to the Football World Cup in Germany it is extremely important that appropriate measures are taken with a view to combating acts of hooliganism and racism. All actors are called upon to contribute to this work in line with their particular roles and competencies.</p>
<p>Concerning racism, the Commission actively supports the promotion of anti-racism in various ways through different programmes and initiatives, often in cooperation with sport organisations. Particular attention is paid to prevention and the exchange of best practice.</p>
<p>In this context, initiatives have been taken to promote and strengthen the educational and social dimension of sport. Sport is a tool for fighting racism and discrimination and for improving integration.</p>
<p>Some of these initiatives have been directly taken with the German authorities by the European Union’s European Monitoring Centre on Racism and Xenophobia (EUMC) in order to urge FIFA<a href="#defann_53_1" name="refann_53_1"><sup>(1)</sup></a>
 to host activities against racism during the World Cup in Germany. They were joined in this initiative by the United Nations and the Football Against Racism in Europe (FARE) network.</p>
<p>FIFA has responded by designating 30 June 2006 and 1 July 2006 as Days against Racism. It will use the quarter-final matches on those days to highlight an anti-racism message which will involve the teams competing in the quarter-final matches. FIFA will also host a high-profile media event on 28 June 2006 to reinforce the message against racism.</p>
<p>In addition, the EUMC is planning to publish a paper identifying elements of good practice in combating racism and promoting racial equality at the club and national football association level. The information in the paper is aimed at providing a template for action and developing approaches. The publication of the paper is planned to coincide with FIFA’s Days against Racism.</p>
<p>On the legal side, it must be stressed that in 1996 the Council adopted a Joint Action concerning action to combat racism and xenophobia.</p>
<p>Further to that, in November 2001, a proposal for a Council Framework Decision on combating racism and xenophobia was presented by the Commission. The purpose of this Framework Decision is twofold: first, to ensure that racism and xenophobia are punishable in all Member States by effective, proportionate and dissuasive criminal penalties and second, to improve and encourage judicial cooperation.</p>
<p>The fight against racism and hooliganism has been the subject of several projects co-financed within the Community action programme for supporting Active European Citizenship and in the field of Youth. For example, some projects have allowed young supporters from various Member States to exchange experiences in Germany on grassroots activities to fight against racism and violence in football on the eve of the World Cup.</p>
<p>At the EU level, specific security-related measures are being implemented, such as improved cooperation between law enforcement agencies by sending liaison officers (EUROPOL, EUROJUST and INTERPOL), including deploying officers of the public safety organisations, and event-related sharing of information related to potential troublemakers in accordance with data-protection law. Concerning safety concerns related to hooliganism, the sharing of information and criminal intelligence is considered to be one of the key means of control and prevent possible problems.</p>
<p>The Commission actively supports the development of improved violence prevention and control initiatives for international sporting events, in particular for football events.</p>

The Directive demands that Member States coordinate their national legislation with a view to guaranteeing - inter alia - that the Member State governments guarantee that the public in general will have freedom of access to broadcasts of major sporting events such as the Olympic Games or the World Cup.</p>
<p>The Spanish Government included the XVIII World Cup in Germany in its catalogue of sporting competitions or events of general interest for the 2005-2006 season.</p>
<p>However, in Spain the open broadcasting rights for the World Cup have been awarded to a newly set-up television channel called 'La Sexta', which, two weeks away from the beginning of the World Cup is guaranteeing broadcasting coverage for a maximum of only 80% of Spanish territory.</p>
<p>Does the Commission believe that the awarding to La Sexta of the broadcasting rights for an event stated to be of social interest, such as the World Cup in Germany, infringes the spirit and letter of TWF by failing to guarantee access for all viewers? Will it take action so that the general interests of Spanish viewers are fully guaranteed, as laid down in the Directive?</p>

<p>(EN) The Commission supports the EU-Africa regional Conference on migration and development, to be held on 10 and 11 July 2006 in Rabat. This event will bring together representatives from countries of origin, transit and destination. It will be focused on the West and Central African migration routes leading to Europe. The main purpose of this Conference is to find joint, regional responses so as to better manage the phenomenon of migration and to further deepen cooperation with the countries concerned.</p>
<p>The Commission expects that the Action Plan to be adopted at the Conference will pave the way for the implementation of concrete and operational measures designed to address the range of migratory issues in the region, including channels for legal migration, fostering the links between migration and development, and combating illegal migration and the trafficking in human beings. At this stage, however, the Action Plan is still in the process of being devised and it is therefore premature to comment on its content in detail.</p>

<p>The Balearic Islands' Regional Government has recently submitted a scheme for setting up a Tourism Research Centre with a view to increasing investment in tourist sector RDI and thus improving the island's competitiveness.</p>
<p>A further objective of the scheme is to reduce the Balearic economic model's structural deficit in innovation.</p>
<p>Does the Commission know of similar initiatives to the setting up of the Tourism Research Centre?</p>
<p>Can the Commission state what European aid will be earmarked from 2007 for co-funding this project and other Balearic Island projects within the framework of RDI?</p>

<p>(EN) Within the framework of the European Regional Development Fund (ERDF) Innovative Actions 2000-2006, on 27 December 2005 the Commission approved €2.34 million for a regional programme of innovative actions: "SAITUR" (Support System for Tourist Innovation) in the Baleares Islands. It is expected that, during 2006 and 2007, the European funding will attract further investment of Euro 2.34 million from the public sector and €0.3 million from the private sector creating total resources of €4.98 million.</p>
<p>The programme aims to create a Research and Development Centre, specialised in tourism and coordinating the island tourism cluster, to consolidate the synergies derived from the expansion of the tourist sector and to integrate the island innovation system that supports it. At the same time, it will take account of issues related to the sustainability of the Balearic’s ecosystem, the new demands of our globalised world and the information society.</p>
<p>In effect, until now, the tourist sector has mainly focussed on traditional issues like hotel management, staff qualifications and marketing. As a result, it has benefited relatively little from technological and innovative developments. The "SAITUR" programme wants to break with that situation and deploy the considerable potential for technological innovation in this sector. One of the starting points will be the cluster concept in tourism, meaning that tourist activities (especially the hotel trade) are perceived as the driving force of a group of other sectors, some of which (aeronautics, nautical supplies, audiovisual…) require a high degree of technology.</p>
<p>The "SAITUR" programme consists of four inter-related actions. The main one is called CIDTUR (Centro de Investigacion y desarrollo sobre el turismo) whose objective is the adaptation of a regional R+D Centre into a scientific-technical reference for innovative actions that can be incorporated into activities related with tourism.</p>
<p>To the Commission knowledge, a similar project/action has not benefited from the Innovative Actions Programme in other regions nor does the Commission know of comparable actions financed under the Structural Funds.</p>
<p>For the 2007-2013 structural fund programming period, the Commission is not in a position, at this stage, to indicate which programmes will be co-funded by the European regional development fund (FEDER) in the Balearic Islands.</p>
<p>Any proposed new "Operational Programme for the Balearic Islands" will have to be presented to the Commission by the Spanish authorities in accordance with the guidelines in the Spanish National Strategic Reference Framework. To date, neither that framework nor that operational programme have been communicated to the Commission.</p>
<p>The proposed operational programme will be subject to a joint analysis by the competent Spanish authorities and the Commission in order to establish the content and the financial envelopes for each priority axis. Specific projects co-funded on the ground within each priority axis must conform to the criteria set in those priority axes.</p>
<p>These innovative actions co-funded by the FEDER will not continue in their current form after 2006. Henceforth, projects of this kind will have to be funded by national authorities within the context of new structural fund operational programmes.</p>

<p>(EN) The Commission is continuously engaged in order to reduce trafficking in human beings as defined in the Council Framework Decision of 19 July 2002 on combating trafficking in human beings,<a href="#defann_57_1" name="refann_57_1"><sup>(1)</sup></a>
 i.e. a serious crime against persons for the purposes of sexual or labour exploitation. Trafficking in human beings has to be distinguished from so-called migrant smuggling, i.e. the facilitation of unauthorised entry, transit and residence as defined in Council Directive 2002/90/EC of 28 November 2002.<a href="#defann_57_2" name="refann_57_2"><sup>(2)</sup></a>
</p>
<p>The Commission's activities against trafficking in human beings concern financial support for anti trafficking projects in EU Member States and third countries through programmes such as STOP<a href="#defann_57_3" name="refann_57_3"><sup>(3)</sup></a>
 and STOP II<a href="#defann_57_4" name="refann_57_4"><sup>(4)</sup></a>
, AGIS<a href="#defann_57_5" name="refann_57_5"><sup>(5)</sup></a>
, DAPHNE<a href="#defann_57_6" name="refann_57_6"><sup>(6)</sup></a>
 and DAPHNE II and legislative initiatives which formed the basis of important legislation at EU level, notably Council Framework Decision of 19 July 2002 on combating trafficking in human beings, Council Framework Decision of 22 December 2003 on combating the sexual exploitation of children and child pornography, Council Directive 2004/81/EC of 29 April 2004 on the residence permit issued to third country nationals who are victims of trafficking in human beings or who have been the subject of an action to facilitate illegal immigration, who cooperate with the competent authorities.<a href="#defann_57_7" name="refann_57_7"><sup>(7)</sup></a>
 Currently, the implementation of this legislation is being evaluated; on 2 May 2006, the Commission issued an evaluation report<a href="#defann_57_8" name="refann_57_8"><sup>(8)</sup></a>
 about the implementation of the Council Framework Decision on combating trafficking in human beings.</p>
<p>On 18 October 2005, the Commission issued its Communication “Fighting trafficking in human beings – an integrated approach and proposals for an action plan”,<a href="#defann_57_9" name="refann_57_9"><sup>(9)</sup></a>
 the fourth communication after previous ones in 1996, 1998 and 2000,<a href="#defann_57_10" name="refann_57_10"><sup>(10)</sup></a>
 in order to promote and strengthen the EU policy against trafficking in human beings. A considerable number of suggestions were incorporated into the EU plan on best practices, standards and procedures for combating and preventing trafficking in human beings, adopted by the EU Council on 1 December 2005;<a href="#defann_57_11" name="refann_57_11"><sup>(11)</sup></a>
 on 27 April 2006, the EU Council also adopted conclusions concerning trafficking in human beings. The EU action plan against trafficking in human beings will guide the EU's policy in the near future. In view of its full implementation the Austrian Council Presidency and the Commission will organise an expert conference on 28 and 29 June 2006.</p>
<p>The crime of human trafficking often has a transnational dimension because numerous trafficked persons move or are brought across external borders. Migrant smuggling and human trafficking are also linked by the fact that they are frequently organised by internationally operating criminal networks and part of organised crime phenomena linked with the demand for cheap and illegal services. For this reason, the prevention of and the fight against human trafficking is an essential element of the EU’s efforts to improve the checks and surveillance at the external borders and to enhance the fight against illegal immigration. As far as the facilitation of unauthorised entry, transit and residence by such networks is concerned, Directive 2002/90/EC and the Framework Decision on the strengthening of the penal framework to prevent the facilitation of unauthorised entry, transit and residence of the same day<a href="#defann_57_12" name="refann_57_12"><sup>(12)</sup></a>
 already play an important role to prevent these criminal activities. The Commission is about to examine the implementation of these instruments. An evaluation report regarding the Framework Decision shall be issued very soon.</p>
<p>Concerning the second question raised by the honourable Member, the Commission would like to point out that these matters fall entirely within the remits of national competence.</p>

<p>(EN) The European Agency for the Management of Operational Cooperation at the External Borders of the European Union (FRONTEX) plays a key role in assessing, together with the Spanish authorities, how to improve the control and surveillance of the Atlantic maritime border between Spain and a number of West African countries, as well as coordinating joint operations and other kinds of assistance to be provided to Spain by Member States and the Community, on the basis of solidarity.</p>
<p>Decisions on the establishment of permanent so called "specialised branches" of the FRONTEX Agency fall under the exclusive competence of the Management Board of the Agency, cf. Article 16 of Council Regulation (EC) No 2007/2004 of 26 October 2004 establishing FRONTEX.</p>
<p>However, the Agency may, for the purpose of coordinating specific operations, decide to set up some kind of temporary coordination units in affected Member States, e.g. in the Canary Islands in connection with up-coming operations.</p>
<p>The Commission is pleased that FRONTEX has already, in the period from 30 May 2006 to 2 June 2006, dispatched a team of experts to the Canary Islands in order to assess the situation on the ground.</p>
<p>On the basis of this assessment mission, appropriate decisions will be taken by the Agency, in particular on the setting up of such a temporary coordination unit as part of the joint operational activities to be undertaken in the region.</p>

<p>In this context, the Commission recalls that according to paragraph 6 of the negotiating framework agreed in October 2005, progress in the accession negotiations is to be measured against a number of requirements, including "Turkey’s unequivocal commitment to good neighbourly relations and its undertaking to resolve any outstanding border disputes in conformity with the principle of peaceful settlement of disputes in accordance with the United Nations Charter, including if necessary compulsory jurisdiction of the International Court of Justice".</p>
<p>Furthermore, under the revised Accession Partnership adopted by the Council in January 2006, Turkey should "address any sources of friction with neighbours and refrain from any action which could negatively affect the process of peaceful settlement of border disputes."</p>

<p>(FR) The Commission recalls that the fight against terrorism and cooperation between Member States in this domain has to be conducted fully in accordance with fundamental rights. In particular, abduction, secret detention or detention without oversight by the judicial authorities constitute violations of the right to freedom and security under Article 5 of the European Convention on Human Rights and under Article 6 of the Charter of Fundamental Rights of the European Union. Furthermore, the Commission recalls that the prohibition of torture and of inhuman or degrading punishment or treatment under Article 3 of the Convention and under Article 4 of the Charter, constitutes an absolute principle which cannot be subject to any derogation, including the context of the fight against terrorism.</p>
<p>The Commission notes that the complaints concerning the Pakistani foreign nationals in Athens are currently the subject of judicial procedure in Greece in order to establish the truth about what took place and the responsibility of the authorities.

<p>Furthermore, the Commission supports, within the limits of its competences, the investigations in progress in Parliament and in the Council of Europe.

<p>(EN) The Special safeguard mechanism (SSM) is a new tool available for developing countries, which was introduced in the 2004 Framework agreement, and is part of the broad special and differential treatment for developing countries. The Honk Kong declaration further specifies that the SSM may be activated on both price and volume triggers.</p>
<p>The EC has been and continues to be favourable to a solution which meets genuine needs of developing countries. The EU considers that both developed and developing countries should have the right to have recourse to safeguard mechanism, in order to react to exceptional market conditions in terms of both import price and volume. In the recent negotiations on SSM, the EU has pushed for a middle ground approach to bridge the gap between the positions of United States on one side and the G-33 on the other.</p>
<p>The EU believes that the SSM should be allowed for a limited number of tariff lines still to be negotiated. The level of triggers should be reasonable and should reflect exceptional market conditions. The mechanism should be transparent to avoid misuse and a proper notification should be guaranteed.</p>
<p>Finally, it is clear that SSM as other Special and Differential Treatment (SDT) on market access should be part of an acceptable market access package, taking account of the sensitivities all members have.</p>

<p>(EN) The Commission is currently discussing a proposal to increase the de minimis aid threshold, currently set at €3.000 per company over a period of three years. At this stage of the procedure, however, it is not possible to state by how much this threshold will eventually be increased. After adoption of the proposal by the College, Member States still need to be consulted twice on the draft, via the Advisory Committee on State aid, as provided for by Council Regulation N° 994/98 of 7 May 1998 on the application of Articles 92 and 93 of the Treaty to certain categories of horizontal State aid<a href="#defann_65_1" name="refann_65_1"><sup>(1)</sup></a>
, before the final adoption of the Regulation setting that new threshold.</p>
<p>Whatever will be the outcome of this current revision of the de minimis threshold, the Commission is of the opinion that the use of de minimis aid, although allowed, does not constitute the right reply to address the economic difficulties that the fishing sector is facing. As indicated in the Communication from the Commission to the Council and the Parliament on Improving the Economic Situation in the Fishing Industry<a href="#defann_65_2" name="refann_65_2"><sup>(2)</sup></a>
, the Commission thinks that both short- and long-term action must be taken to address them. Considering short-term action, the Commission has invited Member States to set up rescue and restructuring aid schemes in accordance with the provisions of the Community guidelines on State aid for firms in difficulty.</p>
<p>As specified in this Communication, the Commission is ready to examine such aid schemes when they provide for restructuring aid for eligible enterprises consisting in investment aiming at restoring their profitability by reducing operational costs. The types of eligible investment are the following for the small-scale fishing fleet:</p>
<p>-	a first change of fishing gear resulting in a less fuel-intensive fishing method,</p>
<p>-	purchase of equipment to improve fuel efficiency (such as econometers), or</p>
<p>-	one replacement of the engine provided that, for vessels under 12 m Loa not using towed gear, the new engine has the same power as the old one or less and, for other vessels operating in small scale fisheries the new engine has at least 20 % less power than the old one.</p>

<p>Paragraph 5 of the negotiating framework provides that "in the case of a serious and persistent breach in Turkey of the principles of liberty, democracy, respect for human rights and fundamental freedoms and the rule of law on which the Union is founded, the Commission will, on its own initiative or on the request of one third of the Member States, recommend the suspension of negotiations and propose the conditions for eventual resumption."</p>
<p>Furthermore, under the revised Accession Partnership adopted by the Council in January 2006, Turkey should "address any sources of friction with neighbours and refrain from any action which could negatively affect the process of peaceful settlement of border disputes."</p>

<p>In the recently adopted European Union Financial Framework for 2007-2013, the Trans-European Networks were allocated a ceiling of EUR 7 billion. That was significantly less than the Commission had originally estimated necessary for the 30 priority projects adopted.</p>
<p>In the light of the above, does the Commission consider that it will be necessary to set priorities among the 30 prioritised projects? Will some projects have to be postponed – and if so, which? Or will additional national funding have to be found?</p>
<p>Does the Commission propose to submit a revised implementation plan, and if so, when?</p>

<p>(FR) The Interinstitutional Agreement of 17 May 2006 established the financial framework for 2007-2013, in commitment appropriations, for each heading. The total funding allocated for Trans-European networks has been set at EUR 7 203 billion (2004 price). The Commission has specified this in its proposal of 24 May 2006. Although this sum is approximately double that fixed within the framework of the financial perspective for 2000-2006, it is considerably lower than the sum initially proposed by the Commission. At the same time the implementation costs for the 30 priority projects of the Trans-European transport network (TETN) have recently been revised upwards. Consequently the resources available are limited in relation to the extent of the need for investment.</p>
<p>That means that if the European Union wants to respect the implementation deadlines for the projects, Member States will have to make greater efforts in terms of investments. Furthermore, there should be more involvement of the private sector. The Commission will continue its efforts with the object of promoting public-private partnerships.</p>
<p>Since it will not be possible to cofinance the priority projects in their entirety, the Commission is considering concentrating the financial resources allocated for the priority projects on the projects which offer the highest European added value, in particular the cross-border sections and the bottlenecks.</p>
<p>The TETN guidelines, which were adopted by the Council and by Parliament in 2004, set out the deadlines for the implementation of the priority projects. Under the new multiannual programme for 2007-2013, Member States will have to give notice of their investment plan for the TETN priority projects and include a timescale for implementation. The Commission will secure compliance with the deadlines which Member States will have to undertake to meet.</p>
<p>As stipulated in Article 19(3) of Decision No 884/2004/EC of Parliament and of the Council of 29 April 2004, the Commission will draw up a report on the progress of the work before 2010.</p>

<p>(EN) From 1 January 2004 to 1 June 2006, 29 officials have been retired in the interest of the service pursuant to Article 50 of the Staff Regulations of EU officials (15 in 2004, 7 in 2005 and 7 in 2006 so far). Article 50 is an exceptional measure applicable only to officials in the highest grades. The conditions governing the payment of the allowance after termination of service are laid down in Annex IV of the Staff Regulations.</p>
<p>The allowance is paid for a maximum period which depends on the official's age and length of service. For example, an official whose service is terminated at age 48 after 10 years will receive the allowance for less than six years. Again, where an official is close to his pension age, the allowance will only be paid for the period until he reaches that age. The allowance is degressive: after six months, it is paid at a rate 70% for five years (or less, if the service is terminated after only a few years), at 60% thereafter (if indeed the period does exceeds five years, which may well not be the case). Since this is an allowance not a pension, the former official also has to declare any earnings from "new employment", which may result in the allowance being reduced. It is possible to calculate that the average basic allowance is 10.383,09 €, assuming a rate of 70% and no reductions. However, the true average for all cases is significantly lower, taking account of possible lower rates and reductions for other earnings.</p>
<p>The possibility of early retirement without reduction under Annex VIII(9)(2) to the Staff Regulations was introduced by the amendments to the Staff Regulations which came into force on 1 May 2004. It is applied on an annual interinstitutional basis, subject to very strict conditions. In the first round, only 26 possibilities were allocated to the Commission, compared to a total of more than 21.000 officials.</p>

<p>The number of countries representing the Baltic region increased markedly with the enlargement of the EU. The 'Baltic Europe' Intergroup set up within the European Parliament has devised a European strategy for the Baltic region that is being discussed not only at the EP but also at the Commission. This strategy addresses the four areas of environmental protection, the economy, education and culture and security.</p>
<p>What action plans or programmes is the Commission considering, for the near future or in the longer term, to enable the Baltic region to start functioning as an effectively operating region and to ensure the conditions are fulfilled for its closer integration?</p>

<p>(EN) The co-operation in the Baltic Sea region has functioned well for many years in a variety of ways – as a political forum for regional co-operation in different areas via the Council of the Baltic Sea States or the Northern Dimension, or via various Structural Funds and external cooperation programmes between Member States and Partner Countries.</p>
<p>The Member States of the Baltic Sea region have the opportunity to foster their regional development via the mainstream Objective 1 and 2 programmes and Cohesion Fund programmes. These programmes are prepared by the Member State concerned taking into account the needs of its regions. The Commission strongly encourages the possibilities to enhance and promote co-ordination and co-operation between the Baltic Sea Region Member States through these programmes. Indeed, it has taken the initiative to propose for the three Baltic States (Estonia, Latvia and Lithuania) to meet at a round table discussion in July 2006 on how these Member States could co-operate and co-ordinate operations and activities in the next programme period. The sectors that have been mentioned as possible areas of interest mirror those referred to in the question of the honourable Member. They include: energy, transport, research and development/ICT, tourism, environment and health care. Another initiative is the ongoing feasibility study on "Rail Baltica", coordinated by the Commission.</p>
<p>The other key set of programmes that contribute to Baltic Sea co-operation are the INTERREG Community Initiative programmes that are being implemented for the period 2000-2006 with the aim of encouraging the harmonious, balanced and sustainable development of the whole of the Community area. Those programmes can be cross border, transnational and interregional. For instance, in the Baltic Sea region there is a successful transnational programme being implemented with the participation of 11 countries (Sweden, Finland, Estonia, Latvia, Lithuania, Poland, Germany, Denmark, Norway, Russia and Belarus) around the Baltic Sea. This Baltic Sea Region programme has funded more than 100 projects. Good results have been achieved in fields such as environment, maritime safety, spatial planning, tourism, transport etc.</p>
<p>Under the Neighbourhood Programmes operating since 2004, Tacis funding has made it possible to extend the existing INTERREG programmes in the Baltic Sea area to include cross-border co-operation also with external partner countries, under the umbrella of jointly addressing challenges in relation to the common neighbourhood.</p>
<p>In the next Structural Funds’ programming period 2007-2013 co-operation will be continued via the European Territorial Co-operation Objective. The themes proposed by the Commission to be implemented in the participating countries cover a wide range of topics including SME co-operation; joint use of infrastructure in sectors such as health, culture, tourism and education; innovation; environment and water management; and sustainable urban development.</p>
<p>New programmes for the period 2007-2013 are being prepared in the Member States concerned to be submitted to the Commission by the end of 2006, so that implementation may start in 2007.</p>
<p>In relation to co-operation between Member States and Partner Countries, the European Neighbourhood and Partnership Instrument (ENPI) will from 2007 provide a specific instrument for cross-border co-operation (CBC), allowing for fully integrated and joint programmes across the EU’s external borders. These programmes, developed, managed and implemented by the programme partners will be able to address issues to support socio economic development, solve common challenges, secure efficient borders and specifically support people-to-people co-operation. Programmes are now being developed along the external land borders, as well as in sea basins. In the Baltic Sea area seven programmes are under development, six land border programmes along the EU’s border with Russia and Belarus, and one sea basin programme covering all the 8 Member States, Norway and the two partner countries in the region.</p>
<p>The ENPI CBC programmes will be able to support initiatives under the Northern Dimension and also in relation to the regional co-operation structures with partner countries in the Baltic Sea area. Through a bottom-up development process these programmes will be able to address true local and regional priorities, a key in bringing regional development forward, creating sustainable success and continue building on the impressive co-operation in the region until today.</p>
