 Mr President, to begin with I must thank my many colleagues who contributed to this document. Seven years ago I was co-rapporteur for the directive, and we are now discussing the report on its application. Parliament’s position has been unanimous throughout, apart from one or two dissenters who, as you will see presently, tabled amendments. We have debated at length and sometimes fiercely, on the sharing of the burden of proof, for example, but happily we never lost sight of the common objective and I hope too that you will see this report as a common undertaking.</p>
<p class="contents">In 2000 we voted by a generous majority in favour of the directive, which can rightly be described as revolutionary. Discrimination was banned Europe-wide – in employment, in social security and housing, and equal treatment was made compulsory. I was and still am inordinately proud of that. Commission, Council and European Parliament did a good job there. But that does not mean, of course, that things have changed very much on the ground. A lot of discrimination still goes on.</p>
<p class="contents">In recent years instances of discrimination and racism have actually increased, both in number and in seriousness. In most countries, unemployment is significantly higher amongst migrants than amongst the rest of the working-age population. There is more racially motivated violence. Legislation is very important in countering discrimination, because it sets the standard. It tells people what the European Union stands for, how we should behave towards one another and what cannot be tolerated. Legislation also gives people a means of redress against discrimination.</p>
<p class="contents">The European Commission is now busy checking whether Member States have properly transposed the European rules into their national laws. I talked about it just this week with Commissioner Špidla, and it is clear that the Commission's intentions are good here – it is keen to ensure, with Member States, that the legislation is implemented. And my compliments to the Commission on that.</p>
<p class="contents">But I cannot help but think that it needs a bit more zip, a bit more oomph. These laws were supposed to be implemented in 2004. There was much talk of sensitivities and difficult details, but when the present Commission took office you announced that measures to combat discrimination would be at the heart of your policy and you are already over halfway through your term. I have the greatest admiration for what you have done so far, but I hope you are going to be twisting Member States’ arms a little harder. That is vital.</p>
<p class="contents">Fewer than half of all Member States have implemented the directive fully. In many of them the definition of direct and indirect discrimination, intimidation and the burden of proof has not been correctly transposed. There are some Member States which certainly prohibit discrimination in employment but which saw it as a step too far to ban it in the provision of goods and services. But those are precisely the areas where there are many problems.</p>
<p class="contents">Take education, for example. According to the new EU Agency for Fundamental Rights, children from Roma families are inappropriately being placed in schools for mentally handicapped children. Or take housing; apartments are routinely advertised with the comment that the complex is ‘foreigner-free’. That is unacceptable.</p>
<p class="contents">The banning of discrimination, in other areas as well as employment, must be made effective immediately. A law is only effective, Mr President, if people know their rights, but according to Eurobarometer only 35% of people questioned think that there are anti-discrimination laws in their country. Fewer still say they would know what to do if they became victims of discrimination themselves. How is the Commission going to guarantee that the law becomes a reality in people’s lives? Informing people is a stated obligation in the directive, but how does the Commission propose to ensure that that obligation is enforced?</p>
<p class="contents">Mr President, even when people do know that a law exists, their path may still be beset by obstacles, because sometimes there are problematic rules and requirements. In some countries the period for filing a complaint is very short, as short as 30 days, for example. The rest of the procedure, by contrast, can be ridiculously long and complicated. Infringement of anti-discrimination laws must be met with effective, proportionate and dissuasive sanctions. That was very nicely said in the directive; we were all agreed on it. But very few countries have adequate sanctions.</p>
<p class="contents">Time for a positive note, maybe. The good thing is that virtually all countries now have equality bodies. That is an important achievement, and in many countries those bodies concern themselves with racially motivated discrimination and with discrimination on other grounds too. I welcome that. But sadly not all bodies have the funds they need to carry out their remit, and so I ask the Commission to consider that point too in its evaluation of how anti-discrimination laws are being implemented. Can the Commission comment?</p>
<p class="contents">To conclude, Mr President: I am proud of the legislation. Progress has been made on transposition, but not yet enough. Many countries have not yet transposed it in full. But even where they have done so to the letter, we still need to be sure that people are properly informed of their rights, because if they are unaware of those rights they cannot invoke them, and that is so very important when it comes to fighting discrimination. </p>

<span class="italic">Member of the Commission</span>

Mr President, Mrs Buitenweg, Members of the House, the Commission welcomes this report on the application of Directive 2000/43/EC of 29 June 2000 implementing the principle of equal treatment between persons irrespective of racial or ethnic origin.</p>
<p class="contents">The Commission notes the various concerns that Parliament has expressed and would draw your attention to a number of points. With regard to monitoring the Member States’ implementation of the Directive, at the end of June the Commission initiated infringement proceedings against 14 Member States for failing to transpose the Directive properly into national law. I would add that a number of Member States have already amended their legislation in response to the Commission’s concerns, or have indicated that they are prepared to do so.</p>
<p class="contents">With regard to detailed information on the Member States’ transposition of the Directive, as we noted in our 2005 Communication on a framework strategy for non-discrimination and equal opportunities for all, we publish the comprehensive report of the Legal Experts Group every year, and the individual national reports are available online.</p>
<p class="contents">Mrs Buitenweg rightly points out that the bodies charged with promoting equality play a key role in combating discrimination. That is why we fund the Equinet network, facilitating exchanges of experience and good practice among Member States’ equality bodies.</p>
<p class="contents">As the report indicates, data collection is a sensitive business. Without it, however, it is impossible to assess the extent of discrimination or to know whether measures that have been taken are effective. Given that much of the information gathered may fall into the category of sensitive personal data, concerning people’s racial or ethnic origins, or indeed their religious beliefs or sex lives, it must be processed in accordance with the relevant provisions of Directive 95/46/EC on the protection of personal data.</p>
<p class="contents">That Directive imposes a general ban on the processing of sensitive personal data. However, it provides for a number of exceptions to the rule, notably if the individuals concerned have given their explicit consent or if – and I quote – processing is necessary for the purposes of carrying out obligations and specific rights in the field of employment law.</p>
<p class="contents">The Member States are also empowered to lay down exemptions – subject to the provision of suitable safeguards – for reasons of substantial public interest. It is thus up to the Member States to decide whether or not they should collect data about ethnic origin, in order to produce statistics with a view to combating discrimination, subject to implementation of the safeguards that the data protection directive requires.</p>
<p class="contents">The Eurobarometer study on discrimination in the European Union demonstrated that large numbers of European citizens were generally prepared to supply personal information anonymously in the context of a census, in order to combat discrimination. Three out of four were prepared to give personal information about their ethnic origin, religion or beliefs.</p>
<p class="contents">Such information is particularly important in the context of positive action to alleviate discrimination and deeply rooted forms of disadvantage. Last February the Commission published a European guide to equality data, with the aim of helping the Member States to improve their data collection practice.</p>
<p class="contents">The same Eurobarometer study of January 2007 revealed that people felt insufficiently informed about their rights as victims of discrimination. While the level of knowledge varied considerably – between Finland, for example, where 65% of those questioned said they were aware of their rights, and Austria, where the corresponding figure was just 17% – the fact that the average was only 32% clearly shows that, just as you have stated, awareness-raising activities are as necessary as ever.</p>
<p class="contents">I am convinced that our current activities, backed up by the European Year of Equal Opportunities for All in 2007, which involved some 430 activities at Member State level, and the European campaign ‘For diversity. Against discrimination’ will help to counter this lack of awareness.</p>
<p class="contents">I would make particular mention here of the training programmes that we finance for NGOs, trade unions, lawyers and companies.</p>
<p class="contents">The Commission is determined to use every available tool to improve the situation of the Roma in the European Union. Specifically this will mean ensuring that Directive 2000/43/EC is applied, utilising the Community Structural Funds, particularly the European Social Fund, and raising awareness among both the Roma themselves and the general public about their rights and obligations.</p>
<p class="contents">A high-level consultative group on the social and vocational integration of ethnic minorities, including the Roma, is to submit its report with a series of recommendations at the beginning of December. The group aims to identify barriers to integration and to promote good practices as applied by public authorities and companies.</p>
<p class="contents">In this context we welcome the European Parliament’s interest in the question of multiple discrimination, and I will certainly be keen to read, at the end of this year, the findings of a new study being conducted for the Commission. Clearly, non-discrimination alone is not enough to provide equal opportunities for certain groups who are more socially disadvantaged than others: the Commission has therefore asked for an in-depth analysis of good practice as applied in the Member States, particularly in relation to employment policy.</p>
<p class="contents">The Commission also considers it very important that the Member States should apply their own laws properly, although legislation in itself is clearly insufficient. We aim to reinforce it through research, awareness raising, training and exchanges of good practice, so as to prevent discrimination where possible and, where that is not possible, to make adequate amends to its victims. </p>

Mr President, colleagues, I should like to thank Mrs Buitenweg for the work she has done, which is of a high calibre. The report makes a number of fair and balanced points, and the major problems with the Directive’s application are covered thoroughly.</p>
<p class="contents">It is true that very few of our fellow citizens are clearly aware of their rights in the event of finding themselves the victims of discrimination. So it would seem essential to ensure that the relevant information is more effectively disseminated, particularly as this is the European Year of Equal Opportunities for All. Specifically, I support the idea of granting sufficient resources to the bodies tasked with promoting equality. Theirs is a key role here and, as the report rightly states, it is imperative that they should remain independent.</p>
<p class="contents">The most worrying point made, however, concerns the failure of certain Member States to transpose the Directive, or to transpose it fully. We absolutely must take steps to ensure that all the Member States enact the laws necessary so that each individual, irrespective of his or her country of residence, can enjoy the essential level of protection.</p>
<p class="contents">With regard to the most sensitive issue addressed, namely data collection, the report is careful to stipulate that it must be carried out in a manner respectful of personal privacy, and solely for the purpose of detecting forms of discrimination from which minorities may suffer. It must never veer into the dangerous territory of ethnic profiling, but it must ultimately deliver the information required for gauging the extent of the discrimination and producing suitable solutions.</p>
<p class="contents">When it comes to a principle of such fundamental importance as equality of treatment, Europe cannot be content simply to pay lip service, Europe cannot be content to enact a bare minimum of legislation, and Europe cannot be content to be a mere observer. We do need to be watchful, but it is also up to us to act, to lead the way and to ensure that Europe sets an example: the more we can do that, the less we leave ourselves open to reproach. </p>

Mr President, Commissioner, first let me thank Mrs Buitenweg for the excellent work she has done. Her report has our full backing. Sadly, recent statistics show that discrimination remains a significant and ongoing problem in many Member States.</p>
<p class="contents">The first report by the European Union Agency for Fundamental Rights, in August 2007, recorded an increase in racist crime in at least eight countries in the Union. This is particularly worrying given that the EU possesses highly developed legislation against discrimination. I agree, however, that the legislation has been poorly transposed and only partially implemented by the Member States. The people of Europe are not well informed and, in particular, they do not realise that they can use the legislation to assert their rights if they find themselves the victims of discrimination.</p>
<p class="contents">As rapporteur on the European Year of Equal Opportunities for All and on the framework decision on combating racism and xenophobia, I believe the Member States need to work harder to ensure that the European legislation is properly applied. The texts we have produced also need to be more widely publicised, so that the people of Europe can identify with them.</p>
<p class="contents">Reversing the burden of proof is the major advance that this Directive on equal treatment has produced. We must therefore insist that practical measures are put in place to secure this advance in all the EU Member States.</p>
<p class="contents">In conclusion, I believe that we need to strengthen the European legal framework for combating discrimination by adopting an across-the-board directive covering all the forms of discrimination cited in Article 13 of the Treaty, and I should like to ask the Commission what progress has been made on studying the feasibility of such a directive. </p>

 Mr President, here in the European Parliament we make laws, but laws alone cannot eliminate racism and xenophobia. The utterances of politicians and other opinion leaders help to foster a climate of hatred and intolerance in which discrimination becomes normal, so that the law remains a dead letter.</p>
<p class="contents">I would like really to see the European Commission attacking discrimination in Europe as consistently as it attacks breaches of market rules, for example. We should protect human capital in Europe just as vigorously as financial capital. If we can take on Bill Gates, surely we can take on companies and authorities which discriminate. We know that 14 governments still have not complied with the Racial Equality Directive in one or two respects, but the Commission does not seem in too much of a hurry to enforce the rules and is giving Member States far too much time to come into line. This law should have been implemented years ago; we would not have let Bill Gates get away with it.</p>
<p class="contents">And in combating terrorism and crime we must not allow shifting goalposts. Some measures apply only to certain groups and appear to legitimise discrimination. Take, for example, stop-and-search practices, profiling methods, etc., etc. Integration measures can sometimes be discriminatory too and I am pleased to see, for example, that the last government in my own country sought to introduce measures on integration which were subsequently thrown out by the courts, because they were indeed discriminatory.</p>
<p class="contents">Of the various amendments, one in particular, Amendment 4, caught my attention. This says that protection of minorities and compliance with anti-discrimination legislation is a matter for the individual Member States. But if there is one thing that is not national, it is our common European values, and so it is very much a European responsibility to ensure equal treatment for every European citizen, because that is the aim of European integration and the market is merely a means to that end.</p>
<p class="contents">Lastly, religious freedom is a great <span class="italic">and</span>
 a fundamental right, but it must not be abused to justify discrimination on the basis of ethnicity. For example, a Catholic school must not use religious freedom as a pretext for excluding children of a certain ethnic background, when what it really wants is to keep the school white. And on the other hand, it is not automatically racist to criticise Islam.</p>
<p class="contents">Lastly, Mr President, laws are important and it is extremely good that we have this law, but we are all keen to maintain a climate in which discrimination no longer occurs. </p>

 Mr President, ladies and gentlemen, I should firstly like to thank our colleague for her work. As the European Parliament’s rapporteur on the rights of minors, I should like to focus on an important part of this report, that is the part on Roma children. I should like to remind everyone here that it is children who suffer the worst problems of discrimination and social exclusion.</p>
<p class="contents">In Europe there are many, too many street children, often from Roma backgrounds, who have no future because they have not had a proper school education and in many cases are completely illiterate. These children do not receive proper medical care or the necessary vaccinations. They are consequently children who do not have a future, because they have been denied their childhood and because they are often forced to beg, to collect handouts, almost always during school hours, or end up in illegal work.</p>
<p class="contents">As the report also says, the Member States have to commit themselves to introducing positive policies against discrimination. In this particular case, policies that guarantee children’s entitlement to an education and that require the families of these Roma children to make sure that they attend compulsory education. Suitable campaigns also need to be run to encourage citizens to work with schools to prevent instances of discrimination, exploitation and social exclusion among children.</p>
<p class="contents">I would also conclude by saying that it is unacceptable that too many Member States, unfortunately including my own country, Italy, have yet properly to transpose the provisions of the Directive into national law. </p>

 Mr President, I would like to thank Ms Buitenweg for this report, which draws attention to one of the more serious issues in Europe’s problem of racial and ethnic discrimination.</p>
<p class="contents">Commissioner, in my opinion the Commission should be more active in order to promote transposition of the Racial Equality Directive. Each day brings us a lot of cases where correct transposition is necessary to protect victims. I would also like to mention that some practices related to linguistic policy may be considered as indirect discrimination under the Directive. For example, in my country, Latvia, as well as in neighbouring Estonia, states which have a high proportion of ethnic minorities, there are disproportionate language criteria for employment, as well as requirements to use only one language in communication with authorities. I believe that if such practices lead to under-representation of racial and ethnic minorities in different areas of social life, Member States have a duty to develop policies aiming at ensuring equal access and avoiding discrimination.</p>
<p class="contents">There is another matter of concern. Sometimes different treatment on the grounds of nationality may be considered as indirect ethnic discrimination. It happens when policy concerning citizenship is aimed at excluding those of minority backgrounds – Roma or Russians, for example.</p>
<p class="contents">I hope that the European courts, as well as the Inter-American Court of Human Rights, which stated that there should not be racial or ethnic discrimination on access to nationality, will not be less progressive and will monitor carefully the impact of policy concerning nationality on persons belonging to different ethnic groups. </p>

 Mr President, ladies and gentlemen, while the anti-discrimination directive is a very good directive and of considerable ethical value, a number of European countries are doing little or nothing at all to transpose the directive and its content into their own law, and in practice racial and ethnic abuse is the order of the day. Italy, for instance, is facing infringement proceedings by the European Union for its failure to transpose this Directive.</p>
<p class="contents">The European Union contends in particular that Italy has failed to transpose the notion of racial harassment into national law, lacks a law reversing the burden of proof, and has no specific provisions to protect against racial and ethnic abuse. Last December, in Opera, a municipality close to Milan, a group of citizens led by the leaders of the national Lega di Alleanza literally hunted down and set fire to tents sheltering thirty or so Roma children. In Pavia, dozens of Roma were chased off with shouts of ‘gas chambers’. On the outskirts of Rome, only a few days ago, 40 hooded attackers armed with sticks, knives and Molotov cocktails attacked a Roma camp in Ponte Mammolo during the night.</p>
<p class="contents">In Italy, almost every day, one or more travellers’ camps are cleared by the local authorities, without the Roma having the most elementary rights. Is this the particular social protection for which the report calls, especially following enlargement, for the Roma? I would also like to stress that the sanctions applicable to breaches of national provisions adopted in accordance with the Directive must be effective, proportionate and dissuasive. I would also point out that on 25 April, we approved…</p>

 Mr President, I am afraid my views on this report are somewhat at odds with what has been said in the House so far, because I find this report strange, strange anyway for an institution that calls itself democratic, because on the basis of a highly questionable directive recommendations are being made which to my mind conflict with fundamental rights and freedoms and in some respects run contrary to fundamental principles of the rule of law.</p>
<p class="contents">The truth is that real discrimination against minorities in Europe or real racism is, fortunately, a very marginal phenomenon which is already adequately and very properly combated. This report is about something quite different. What we have here is an umpteenth attempt at introducing rules which will further muzzle and imperil freedom of expression, creating a climate of increasing mental terror in which people native to a country end up being obliged to discriminate positively in favour of those of non-native stock. This is yet another report that discriminates against the non-immigrant.</p>
<p class="contents">So I particularly see reversal of the burden of proof in matters of discrimination and litigation, especially in employment cases, as utterly reprehensible in countries founded on the rule of law where you are deemed innocent until proved guilty.</p>
<p class="contents">In short, this report is not concerned with discrimination; it is a kind of legalisation of political correctness. </p>

 To being with, allow me to thank Mrs Buitenweg for the work she has done on this report. Allow me also to look at this issue from another angle.</p>
<p class="contents">Increasing mobility of people is compelling us to be more open to those who come to our countries. However, this openness starts with family upbringing. It is in the family that children are most likely to learn to respect others. The family is the first community that should teach openness, respect and solidarity. Educating against racial and ethnic intolerance must become a visible pillar of all aspects of upbringing and education, both in school and society as a whole. Upbringing and education must concentrate on the ethical bases that strengthen family unity.</p>
<p class="contents">For this reason, the issue of interaction between cultures, like that of peace and respect for diversity, have now become political and security issues of great importance. The fight against racial discrimination focuses mainly on the manner in which we wish to ensure co-existence between peoples and nations at the beginning of the new century and millennium. Naturally, some legislation is necessary, but our society should deal with racial and ethnic discrimination in such a way that we honestly assess the past and together seek a future for every human being where the dignity and intrinsic rights of each person are respected. </p>

 Thank you, Mr President. If 60% of people surveyed feel that they are subject to some sort of unfair discrimination, then this is a warning to the Member States and a warning to Europe.</p>
<p class="contents">Discrimination on the grounds of ethnic or racial origin is still alive, and it is to be feared that this will continue to be the case for a long time, since Europe is becoming increasingly diverse and ethnic differences are becoming more visible, and even countries that consider themselves mono-ethnic are becoming home to increasingly diverse cultures.</p>
<p class="contents">Mrs Buitenweg’s excellent report provides an opportunity for assessment and reflection. Today, meanwhile, the Commission has brought us a promise of progress in this regard since if several countries have failed to implement the Directive appropriately, then the warning is justified and help is vitally needed. Almost every one of my fellow Members has said that if citizens are unaware of their right to protection from discrimination, they will be unable to exercise this right.</p>
<p class="contents">Discrimination on racial or ethnic grounds raises problems in a broader context too, since belonging to an ethnic minority is primarily a question of identity. We in Eastern/Central Europe have not had a very positive experience as regards willingness to supply data, to the point where a person is a ‘Gypsy’ if his milieu considers him to be one, and this tends to be a matter of lifestyle rather than one of genuine racial identity. The Agency for Fundamental Rights will be able to do a great deal to improve this situation.</p>
<p class="contents">I have two other comments. First, implementation of the Directive can go a long way towards ensuring that the Roma community does not drift outside Europe. Second: with the new Member States, new ethnic blocks have emerged on the map of European history. It is a sad legacy of the 20th century and the two world wars that contradictions continue to live on, and wounds have not yet healed. We are all responsible. Thank you, Mr President. </p>

 Mr President, I welcome very much the Commission taking infringement proceedings against 14 Member States for failure to properly implement the Directive.</p>
<p class="contents">I am chastened to see that my own state, the UK, is on the list. One of the issues in the case of my country is that the definition of indirect discrimination does not comply. Clearly there is no room for complacency, even in a country that has had legislation against race discrimination for over 40 years.</p>
<p class="contents">Strong political will is needed on this subject, which makes it all the more disappointing that the Council did not think this debate important enough for it to be represented.</p>
<p class="contents">I was very interested to hear the statistic quoted by Commissioner Michel that three out of four Europeans are willing for data on ethnic origin to be collected on an anonymous basis, and I welcome the fact that the Commission has done a lot of work in this area in recent years and produced a guide for best practice. We have come a very long way since 1999, when I dared put the words ‘ethnic monitoring’ in my draft report on the European Year against Racism and got whole bucketloads of objections.</p>
<p class="contents">I obviously agree with Mr Gaubert that we have to watch carefully that ethnic and racial data collected for purposes of highlighting and fighting discrimination does not itself become a tool of discrimination through racial or ethnic profiling.</p>
<p class="contents">I should like to ask the Commissioner to what extent, besides data protection safeguards, the police in their operations – which are, of course, a supply of services – fall within the scope of the discrimination ban, such as in their conduct of stop-and-search operations. The police as employers clearly fall within that scope, but I have never been entirely clear to what extent the Directive applies to police operations.</p>

Mr President, when looking at the situation as regards implementation of European Union Directives, including the Directive introducing the principle of equal treatment between persons irrespective of racial or ethnic origin, I have found, as did the rapporteur, that many Member States have taken this Directive on board to a considerable extent, even going beyond the scope that it covers. With insignificant exceptions, Member States have given considerable attention to the full range of equal treatment between persons. Certain gaps and oversights remain that need additional work. Sometimes the regulations are contained in various legislative acts, but this should not create a barrier for the law to be implemented on the national level.</p>
<p class="contents">I believe that the legislative framework in the European Union is on a good level. What is more of a problem is the consciousness of people who may allow themselves to discriminate against third parties. At this time, however, we have to find an answer to the following question: how can we develop people’s consciousness and sensitivity in our global world? In a world where, for many different reasons, people are constantly changing their places of residence...</p>

 Mr President, the problem with a report like Mrs Buitenweg’s is that one starts from worthy principles and good intentions, but unfortunately a wide gulf separates these from actual reality. Of course discrimination on grounds of race or origin is reprehensible. The question is whether that discrimination is as widespread as people would always have us believe. The latest annual report of EUMC, the European Union Monitoring Centre on Racism and Xenophobia, talks of an increase in the phenomenon, but cannot give concrete figures to back this up. EUMC cannot even provide a generally accepted definition of what discrimination is.</p>
<p class="contents">All too often the assumption is that virtually all problems involving immigrants are the result of alleged discrimination against them. This has disastrous effects, because it absolves whole population groups from personal responsibility. This policy of molly-coddling and the culture of victimhood have only made the problem worse, and I am happy to endorse the minority position expressed by Koenraad Dillen. </p>

 Mr. President, Ladies and Gentlemen, first of all, please allow me to express my appreciation of the consistency and quality of this report, as well as to point out the importance of the subject for the improvement of people’s lives and the development of communities. In my speech, I would like to draw attention to the importance of education in implementing the European principles and provisions in the field of equality of treatment for individuals.</p>
<p class="contents">The report correctly emphasizes the fact that laws are effective only when citizens are aware of their own rights. It still remains a requirement to inform citizens, but also to educate them in order to respond; in fact, in order for them to defend themselves. It is only when people have the courage to speak, write and resort to their rights that discrimination phenomena can be limited.</p>
<p class="contents">At the same time, education for tolerance is extremely important for the survival of any community. Learning to live with other people, to accept differences not like a fatality, but like an opportunity to build the whole, means following the right path towards eradicating this type of phenomena. </p>

 Mr President, the European Union has good laws, established anti-discriminatory standards, and directives are in preparation. I would like to congratulate my colleague on the report that she has presented today. In turn, Member States introduce that which is decided here. States have anti-discrimination clauses in their constitutions and they have entire sections of law that are supposed to protect the citizen from discrimination. Why then is the current situation so bad? Why is it that there are still so many examples of discrimination, which we are unable to deal with?</p>
<p class="contents">It seems to me that the problem lies on two levels. Firstly, information, and, secondly, implementation of obligations. I would like to focus on information. Information is not just the responsibility of governments. As it turns out, governments do not provide much information to ordinary people about the nature of discrimination. It seems to me that this role should be taken over to a greater degree by non-governmental organisations, which are well placed to deal with specific areas of society, specific groups of citizens, and to provide them with information about what immigration means. Just ask immigrants, older women, single mothers, whether they feel they are discriminated against. They say: ‘No, it’s just our destiny. It’s just bad luck’. They need help to find themselves; they need help with procedures and appropriate authorities.</p>
<p class="contents">I would also like the European Parliament to get involved in preparing a code of practice that would be given to different organisations. I would like to say one last thing. I hope that the European Commission project involving the yellow lorry travelling round Europe with an anti-discrimination exhibition and the European Year of Equal Opportunities do not represent the full extent of what we can do. Let us do more to help those who are subject to discrimination. </p>

Mr President, the introduction of a principle such as equal treatment between persons irrespective of racial or ethnic origin, as also irrespective of their skin colour, creed or religion, generally involves ongoing and unceasing activity. Any step of progress towards the goal can be counted as a great success. We cannot expect to change the attitudes of everyone overnight, that everyone should rid themselves of their natural condition, which is to improve their lives and fight against whatever could potentially endanger that improvement. However, we must do everything to remove legal, sociological and economic barriers, provide education, create conditions for harmonious coexistence and change our negative attitudes towards other people, whatever the differences between us. Finally, I would like to say that I absolutely do not agree with the statement made by Mr Vanhecke regarding attitudes. </p>

 Mr President, in welcoming this Commission communication, I regret that, despite this and other legislation, discrimination across the EU has not decreased but has increased dramatically.</p>
<p class="contents">I would like to respond to those from the far right who challenge this because, let me tell you, that this year alone, I have met around 500 people from the Sikh community from France, from Belgium, from Italy, from Germany, all citing shocking cases of unacceptable discrimination against them because of their appearance: because they wear a turban.</p>
<p class="contents">Since 2004, there have been a number of Sikh boys who have been expelled from schools in France for not removing their turban. There are similar cases in Belgium and Germany.</p>
<p class="contents">Whilst the French High Court ruled that Sikh men could wear their turban on their driving licence ID photo, the French Ministry, within 24 hours of this verdict, expressly forbade it.</p>
<p class="contents">At Brussels Airport, Sikh men are regularly asked to remove their turbans, which is considered a major insult.</p>
<p class="contents">Furthermore, I receive weekly calls from Italy about people unable to go about their daily business because they are Sikhs. So these cases are clearly a violation of everything that this report is asking for and what the Commission is propagating.</p>
<p class="contents">Therefore, I would like to ask the Commissioner what he and the Commission are doing to challenge these cases of discrimination. We cannot talk about unity and diversity and then ignore practices of governments of many Member States.</p>
<p class="contents">I would like to congratulate Ms Buitenweg, the rapporteur on this report, for bringing forward measures that I hope will give some redress to those who are being marginalised because of ignorance and because of a lack of awareness and respect for other people’s culture.</p>
<p class="contents">Finally, I sincerely hope that in this year of equal opportunity, and next year of intercultural dialogue, we have the will to ensure that our deeds reflect our words. </p>

Mr President, it is clear that, in the 21st century, no one can do other than support the struggle against discrimination. I too am in favour of this report, although I believe that prejudices are based on culture, civilisation and religion, rather than race or ethnicity. I would like to add, by the way, that it would be easier for us in Europe to abide by principles of non-discrimination if we introduced controlled immigration policies for people that we wanted in our countries, as, in principle, no one will act in an aggressive and unfriendly manner to a partner that they chose themselves.</p>
<p class="contents">This report basically speaks about the rights of immigrants. However, let us also consider their responsibilities. It would be easier not to show discrimination to foreigners and people from other cultures if they showed respect for the culture and traditions of the people in the country to which they have come, and if they showed a desire to integrate and did not create a state within a state in our Europe, which has, and we must face the facts, its roots in Christianity. </p>

Mr President, I am grateful to Mrs Buitenweg for the outstanding job she has done on this report. Discrimination and racism on all fronts, whether in the job market, in sports clubs or at school, is an attack on the values which we in Europe hold dear. What we need is a combined approach at all levels, European, national and local. Legislators, politicians and victims of discrimination themselves all have an important part to play here. We must make Europe’s citizens aware of their rights and the means at their disposal for insisting on those rights.</p>
<p class="contents">I urge the Commission to act on its responsibilities and see to it that the Racial Equality Directive is implemented promptly and properly. The Directive is a step in the right direction, but its efficacy depends on how well it is implemented by Member States. And I call on the Commission to show the moral leadership which Barroso himself announced in 2004, and which is sorely needed. Discrimination is still a routine occurrence in Europe in 2007, the European Year of Equal Opportunities for All. Now above all, at a time when some groups are certainly not having an easy ride – I am thinking particularly of the position of Muslims in Europe – we need people who will stand up against discrimination and be counted in all areas.</p>
<p class="contents">I too would like to see the Commission extend anti-discrimination measures to all conceivable forms of discrimination. </p>

 Mr President, I would like to congratulate the rapporteur on preparing a report that I hope will help to protect people from racial and ethnic discrimination as well as achieve greater success in obtaining legal redress.</p>
<p class="contents">We have much work to do in seeking to effectively implement the directives on ethnic and employment equality. The citizens of the EU Member States (especially the new ones) still do not know their rights; either they do not have enough time, or it is financially impossible for them to defend their rights. In the majority of countries, those suffering from discrimination do not manage to join forces and appoint more powerful associations to defend their collective rights. It is difficult to collect information on these thorny issues identifying indirect discrimination or assessing the extent of discrimination in society. Therefore, the European Commission faces problems in supervising the implementation of directives and determining the reasons for the miserable situations in which discrimination exists.</p>
<p class="contents">I support my colleagues’ recommendations to allocate more resources to non-governmental organisations that inform citizens and provide legal aid for the victims of discrimination. The role of the media is also very important.</p>
<p class="contents">Thus, I would like to address my colleagues. We all have offices in the countries in which we are elected. There we could provide and finance initial legal consultations during which people would be informed about the legal acts prohibiting discrimination and the possibilities of making use of the right of legal redress. In short, we could help people directly.</p>
<p class="contents">We could more actively mobilise the political will to strengthen the fight against racial discrimination and employment inequality. </p>

Mr President, ladies and gentlemen, let me begin by assuring you that I will, of course, convey to my colleague Vladimir Špidla the broadly positive comments that I have heard in relation to his efforts. I believe the appreciation is justified and I will certainly pass it on. I will obviously transmit to him, too, the European Parliament’s comments and its urgent requests, or expectations, with regard to the work that remains to be done.</p>
<p class="contents">I should like to make one thing clear at the outset. I certainly do not share – and the Commission does not share – certain views that have been expressed reflecting a tendency towards exclusion, and I am glad to say that they are marginal. Similarly, I feel bound to comment on the claim that there is a risk of creating a state within the Christian state, or within Christian Europe. It goes without saying that I have the fullest respect for the individual citizens who think along such lines, but I feel bound nonetheless – and I do see it as a duty – to remind you quite simply that Europe does not speak with one voice, religiously, philosophically or politically. I believe that stating the obvious like this is sometimes worthwhile. </p>
<p class="contents"><span class="italic">(NL) </span>
Mrs Buitenweg and Mrs In ’t Veld rightly pointed to a fundamental problem, namely transposition of the directives into national law. The Commission is fully aware that we need to keep up the pressure on those Member States which have not yet complied with the European legislation. The Commission shares this concern with the bodies that oversee these important matters in the Member States; as you know, of course, we provide firm and willing support to those equality bodies and organisations. </p>
<p class="contents"><span class="italic">(FR) </span>
With regard to the new initiative, we are currently assessing its impact: the process of studying its effects on discrimination has already begun. Obviously we need to know the extent of the problem. Consultations are currently in progress with the general public, with NGOs and the social partners, within companies and at the European Parliament. All being well, we will have a report on the impact assessment in January 2008. The next step will be inter-service consultation in March and April 2008. The initiative will be included in the Commission’s 2008 work programme, which is currently under consideration and is to be published in late October or early November. If it is adopted as proposed, the Commission will receive a proposal in June 2008, and the procedure should then take its course.</p>
<p class="contents">So there we have it: it goes without saying that our thinking and our analysis are closely akin to that of the Members who spoke in the debate – or at least the majority of them – and I should like, on behalf of the Commission, to congratulate Mrs Buitenweg on her excellent work. I think that what we have seen here is an example of just how crucial Parliament’s role can be in promoting a rights-based Europe that respects its minorities and, indeed, all its citizens. </p>

I would like to congratulate my fellow Member Mrs Kathalijne Buitenweg on the report she has produced, and at the same time draw attention to a number of important problems.</p>
<p class="contents">European citizens’ awareness of the law is rather limited, and the very people who are victims of unfair discrimination, in other words ethnic minorities – and particularly the Roma –, are almost completely unaware of the relevant legal provisions or the structures that offer them legal protection. This is why so few discrimination cases are taken to court in the European Union. Moreover, the financial penalties imposed in such cases are ridiculously low, especially compared with similar proceedings conducted in the United States. Member States should have a responsibility and an obligation to inform and educate the public to ensure that as many citizens as possible across society are aware of their rights and possibilities.</p>
<p class="contents">Equality bodies operate at a distance from citizens; it would hardly be an exaggeration to say that they only operate on paper, without active participation on the part of those affected. Another problem is that, to be able to operate, these bodies depend to a major extent on the governments of the Member States in terms of financing, infrastructure, human resources and policy.</p>
<p class="contents">We need to establish an efficient, European-level system of accountability and monitoring and to make the annual reports more systematic, enabling us to observe whether equality bodies are functioning independently. </p>

The report on equality between women and men in 2007 offers an occasion firstly for saluting the European Union’s commitment to women’s rights, which goes all the way back to 1957. However, as shown by recent statistics compiled when Romania and Bulgaria joined the Union, we can scarcely be content with the situation as it stands.</p>
<p class="contents">In the first place, access to the labour market and status in the labour market remain, for far too many women, largely aspirational. Thirty-two years after the Council Directive requiring that women and men should receive the same pay for the same work, the gap is still too wide, at 15% on average.</p>
<p class="contents">Secondly, achieving gender equality will require greater efforts to combat exclusion and unequal treatment, especially in rural areas where women who work alongside farmers – as assisting spouses – can suffer serious injustice in the event of divorce or in relation to property inheritance or access to property. Nor are these women always taken into account in statistical analyses.</p>
<p class="contents">We need, as a matter of urgency, to give practical effect to various pieces of legislation. Part of the European Union’s role in this vitally important struggle is also to ensure, through awareness raising and more effective prevention, that national cultures evolve and converge. </p>

 Mr President, firstly I would like to express my gratitude to the Commission for drafting this very important report. Equality between women and men is an issue that continues to deserve our full attention. Although much has been achieved in the past decades, important challenges remain.</p>
<p class="contents">The focus of the Commission report is on employment issues. For example, the gender pay gap, insecurity in the job market and the reconciliation of professional and family life are issues that have a bearing on the lives of millions of women every single day. They are also clearly linked to the demographic challenge facing Europe. As the Commission report indicates, six million of the eight million jobs created in the EU since 2000 have been taken up by women. Most of these six million new jobs for women come from the services sector. The 11.7 million new jobs created by the services sector are mostly occupied by women. That is why the services sector, its growth and the internal market are such a key issue for many women in Europe.</p>
<p class="contents">However, the majority of new jobs for women are part-time jobs, some of them unsafe and insecure with low salaries. Fixed-term contracts are also a big problem for many women in Europe, who would like to have more sustainability and stability in their family life as well. Commission figures show that, in the EU, 32% of women in employment have a part-time job, compared to only 7% of men, so there is clearly a gender dimension in the part-time job market in Europe.</p>
<p class="contents">The gender pay gap, on which the Commission issued an initiative in July, is 15% on average across the EU, and up to 30% in some European countries. The gender pay gap has not decreased, although directives on the principle of equal pay for men and women have been in place for more than 30 years, so it is very timely that the Commission has taken up this issue. On the other hand, we know that Member States that have adopted policies reconciling professional and family life for both women and men have higher birth rates, a higher percentage of women in the labour market and higher employment rates.</p>
<p class="contents">Across the EU, women also hold the majority of highly-skilled, non-manual jobs. This week there was quite wide coverage of a Finnish study about women leaders in business. A total of 14 000 Finnish companies were looked at and women business leaders made a 1% better return every year for the stakeholders of companies than male leaders. That is 10% better than men. Even though all the other things were removed from the calculation, there was clearly an advantage for women in business leadership, so this is also something that the Commission is going to take into account in the future.</p>
<p class="contents">In Finland, as in other countries, education has been the key for female advancement. The rise in educational standards has gone hand in hand with increased female employment. In Finland, for example, 32.7% of women are highly skilled, compared to only 24.3% of men, according to the Commission study. So all the initiatives in the field of education and life-long learning that the Commission has tabled are needed and it is very important that we keep education focused on gender policies.</p>
<p class="contents">My report calls for specific measures to combat inequalities caused by interrupted patterns of employment resulting from maternity leave and leave to take care of dependants. It caused the Commission to develop gender analyses on the impact of pension reforms on women’s lives in the EU with the objective of individualising pension rights as well as the social security and tax system. What I find particularly important is that the report urges Member States to mutualise the cost of maternity leave allowance in order to ensure that women no longer represent a more costly source of labour than men. I certainly hope that my own Member State, which has a world record Government of 60% women ministers, will take on board this issue and mutualise paternity/maternity leave costs.</p>
<p class="contents">The report also underlines the need to address the major democratic deficit. We want to investigate the situation that prevents women’s participation in politics and in senior management in public administration at all levels and, if possible, take measures to combat such situations. Attention must also be paid to the situation of women belonging to ethnic minorities and women immigrants, as their marginalisation is reinforced by multiple discrimination from both outside and within their own communities. I urge the Commission to cooperate with Member States to collect relevant data and to enforce measures that would prevent human trafficking for sexual exploitation and forced labour.</p>
<p class="contents">I think that we can finish on a very positive and encouraging note. Women today have opportunities that most of their mothers and grandmothers could never have dreamt of. Women who are reaping the benefits of the brave new world should speak out, and I think that it was very important that the Commission took the initiative to table this report. We continue to fight for full equality for both genders in Europe. </p>

Mr President, Mrs Kauppi, Members of the House, obviously the Commission warmly welcomes this report and the motion for a resolution on equality between women and men in the European Union. Adoption of the report will underscore Parliament’s commitment to gender equality. I should like to thank and congratulate Mrs Kauppi, as the rapporteur, for the fact that the text expresses support for the European Commission’s approach and the measures it is taking to promote equality between women and men.</p>
<p class="contents">In the first place, gender equality is one of the founding values of the European Union. It is also an area in which Europe has led the way, in many cases anticipating developments in society. Over the past few years, a number of important and ambitious initiatives have been launched. The adoption of the Roadmap for equality between women and men highlighted the Commission’s unstinting commitment to push forward resolutely on all fronts in pursuit of effective equality between women and men in every field.</p>
<p class="contents">The Commission welcomes the emphasis that Parliament’s resolution places on certain themes which the Roadmap also identifies as priority areas for action, particularly equality between women and men in terms of economic independence, the reconciliation of working and private lives, the balance of gender representation in decision-making posts, and the need to combat stereotypes.</p>
<p class="contents">While there has undoubtedly been progress in the pursuit of equality between women and men, major challenges clearly remain. The Commission agrees with the rapporteur that we must continue our efforts and consolidate what has been achieved. The Commission is aware, in this respect, of the importance of applying the <span class="italic">acquis communautaire</span>
 effectively, and it will determinedly pursue its role as guardian of the Treaties. It will not hesitate to initiate infringement proceedings if it believes that a European directive has not been properly transposed. There are several current examples of infringement procedures under way, at various stages, in relation to equality between women and men.</p>
<p class="contents">In order to improve compliance with Community law, the Commission has set up a network – known as the Network of Equality Bodies – linking the organisations responsible at national level for promoting equality in the treatment of women and men. The Commission believes that pooling of their respective national-level experience and closer cooperation with the Commission itself can make the various equality bodies more effective in their role of promoting equality of treatment and ensuring that the national agencies responsible for interpreting the legislation do so more uniformly.</p>
<p class="contents">The report also emphasises the central importance of reconciling working and private lives in the process of achieving real equality between men and women. This reflects the Commission’s own thinking. We are well aware that, in the majority of households, family and domestic responsibilities continue to be borne by women. Women are thus more likely than men to have to interrupt, or indeed abandon, their education or career, and this inevitably spawns gender inequalities in relation to work, as well as eroding women’s productive potential. Providing accessible, affordable childcare services of high quality is crucially important as a means of boosting the female employment rate – a point made in the Barcelona objectives. The Commission is to report in 2008 on progress towards these objectives.</p>
<p class="contents">The Commission has also undertaken a process of consultation with the social partners on the reconciliation of working and private lives, the second phase of which concluded at the end of July. In the Commission’s view, this is a complex question that needs to be addressed through a whole range of instruments. At the same time, however, existing Community legislation could be amended to take better account of the challenges that Europe must address. The Commission is currently studying the social partners’ responses to the consultation, and it will use these as a basis for taking the necessary steps. We will also continue to support exchanges of good practice in this field, as reflected in the draft resolution.</p>
<p class="contents">I would reiterate here that respect for the principle of equality between all women and all men is one of the European Union’s fundamental values. That being so, the question of balanced participation by women and men in decision-making is absolutely crucial. It is therefore one of the priorities in the Roadmap for equality between women and men which the Commission adopted last year.</p>
<p class="contents">I should like to conclude by emphasising how important it is to combat stereotyping, a point made several times in the report. Stereotypes probably constitute the toughest obstacle in the way of equality between women and men, and combating them demands effort beyond the contexts of legislation and financial measures: it is about changing forms of behaviour, attitudes and values that determine and influence men’s and women’s roles in society and the career choices they make. Equality policy has always been a driver of change in behaviour and ways of thinking, and it will continue to play that role. The Commission warmly welcomes Parliament’s support in the shape of this motion for a resolution. </p>

 As draftsman for the Committee on Agriculture and Rural Development, I would like to underline the importance of approving some of the proposals contained in our opinion which were not included in Mrs Kauppi’s report, and to request your support for approving them in this plenary in view of their importance for millions of women farmers and rural workers whose activities need to become more visible, through the inclusion of those women in statistics as agricultural, rather than domestic, workers.</p>
<p class="contents">It is vital for their legal status as women working in agriculture to be fully recognised, for equal rights and opportunities to become effective, including in social security. Motherhood must be given effective protection and there needs to be better access to healthcare, education, lifelong learning, facilities for children and families, especially nurseries, local cultural centres and markets, all of which requires more investment and better public services in rural areas. This is the only way to combat the high levels of poverty and isolation affecting women in some rural areas and to achieve better social cohesion. </p>

 Mr President, more women now work, but unfortunately a disproportionate number work in insecure jobs. That means women have to be flexible yet are paid little. The triple C jobs are mainly reserved for women: C for cleaning, C for caring and C for cashiering in supermarkets and shopping malls. Yet we women want triple M jobs: M for money – equal pay for equal work – M for management – more and more women are highly trained so they should have no difficulty in penetrating the glass ceiling to management – and, finally, M for motherhood – yes, we want to be able to combine job, career and motherhood, and for that we need considerably more political support.</p>
<p class="contents">We do not just need more childcare places, as stated in the Barcelona objectives. No, we need childcare of the highest quality. All mothers and fathers must be able to afford childcare and the Community must fund it. It is not just the children of well-to-do parents who should receive maximum support from a very early age onwards. We do not just need equal rights for men and women, we also need equal rights for all children. Education and training do not begin at school, but much earlier. We have to change our way of thinking here.</p>
<p class="contents">Much of this can be found in Mrs Kauppi’s first-class report. We support it. Congratulations to the rapporteur. </p>

 Mr President, ladies and gentlemen, I should also like to congratulate Mrs Kauppi for this report, which offers a snapshot of the current situation in the world of work in Europe. While we have had various opportunities to look at this issue in the Committee on Women’s Rights and Gender Equality, Mrs Kauppi has helped to pinpoint, and to shed light on, a problem, and that problem is that in Europe there is once again a wage gap in the world of women, a difference in pay for equal work which cannot be tolerated.</p>
<p class="contents">This is the case even though school attendance rates among women are high, women now account for 59% of European graduates, women’s participation in the working world has increased significantly, and women are now gaining a great deal of recognition for the results that they are obtaining. What I believe is more important, however, is that the report highlights some of the features which continue to make women’s participation in the working world difficult, with the result that this is happening in practice without any justification – and runs counter to European laws and the laws of the Member States, which prohibit different wages in the working world. This is not just happening in the south of Europe, as is usually said, but throughout Europe, even in the Nordic countries, even in those countries in which tradition leads us to accept that women’s participation in the working world and the institutions is nowadays better consolidated and better recognised.</p>
<p class="contents">I believe, therefore, focusing on one of the questions raised by Mrs Kauppi, whether full mutualisation of the costs of maternity benefits and parental leave should be general practice in the Member States, that those costs, while they are still partly borne by firms, encourage employers to recruit smaller numbers of female staff, which, in turn, has an impact on their careers. </p>

 Mr President, Commissioner, in thanking the rapporteur for her fine report I want to stress, first of all, the harmony that has marked the joint endeavours of all the European institutions on gender equality policies throughout 2007. The strong commitment of our institutions to gender equality, as shown by the European Pact for Gender Equality adopted by the European Council and the Roadmap for Equality between Women and Men in force until 2010, is highly commendable.</p>
<p class="contents">As to the indicators referred to in the report, and bearing in mind the report for the previous year, the lack of significant progress towards equal pay for equal work, which Mrs Sartori has just mentioned, is regrettable and rightly criticised in the report. The gender pay gap in the European Union continues at 15%; to narrow it will require a greater effort in the coming years.</p>
<p class="contents">An encouraging item of information in the report is that six of the eight million jobs created in the European Union since 2000 have been filled by women, although there are considerable age differences that also need correcting.</p>
<p class="contents">A crucial point arising from the report is the importance of equality policies in relation to the demographic challenge facing Europe. It is a fact that those Member States that have adopted policies aimed at reconciling private and working life for women and men have higher birth rates, a higher percentage of women in the labour market and higher employment rates.</p>
<p class="contents">It is also a matter of concern that older women and mothers in single-parent families continue to be the groups at the greatest risk of exclusion.</p>
<p class="contents">Finally, may I point out, along with the report, that it would be interesting and very useful if future annual reports on equality between women and men included statistics for candidate countries, which could then be used in the negotiations. </p>

Mr President, ladies and gentlemen, my congratulations to Mrs Kauppi on an important report.</p>
<p class="contents">Gender equality is one of the EU’s fundamental principles, as Commissioner Michel also said, but it is just one basic principle ‘on show’ in speeches and declarations such as these. In reality the EU is not very interested in equality between women and men. That was obvious in the Commissioner’s speech too. He said that the EU will do all it can. There is nothing very concrete there. What will the EU do to ensure that the directives it has adopted on equal pay and many other issues are actually implemented?</p>
<p class="contents">In my opinion, the EU should actually wake up to the fact that men and women should have more equal status in Europe. The EU talks a lot, but does less, and the Member States also talk a lot but do less. In fact this issue does not shake people into action, at least not the EU’s leaders. I suppose that is just as true for the top decision-makers and the labour market organisations in our own countries. There are other more important things. It is also conspicuous in the fact that the pay gap is still at a level of 15% in the EU countries generally and in my country, a pioneer in the matter of equality, it is, regrettably, 20%.</p>
<p class="contents">I hope the Commissioner and the Commission as a whole will one day realise and recognise the importance of this and do something about promoting the EU principle of equality between women and men. Today it is just empty words. </p>

 Mr President, I congratulate the rapporteur on her report. There are many points in it to which I would like to refer, but I shall focus on two that seem to me the most pertinent.</p>
<p class="contents">First, I welcome the fact that the Commission’s report for 2007 concentrates on employment issues such as the pay gap, conciliation and the directives on equal treatment, given that the economic independence of women is one of the priorities in the Roadmap for Equality between Women and Men.</p>
<p class="contents">It is quite true – as the Commission’s report says – that six of the eight million jobs created in the European Union since 2000 are occupied by women. This would be a clearly positive development, were it not for the fact that the majority of the new jobs occupied by women are part-time; many are insecure and badly paid, and hold out little prospect of wage increases.</p>
<p class="contents">The report also points out that there has been no significant progress in reducing the gender pay gap: that must give cause for concern when the average pay for women is 15% lower than that of men, and in some countries as much as 30% lower.</p>
<p class="contents">The second point I wish to emphasise concerns a particular category of women, those working in agriculture. There is a need to improve the legal situation of such women, both with regard to social security, to which they should be guaranteed direct access, and with regard to their role in agricultural holdings, where a strong stand must be taken on the co-ownership of family holdings, access to credit and succession rights.</p>
<p class="contents">The Commission should pay special attention to both these issues. In concrete terms, it must redouble its efforts to achieve greater equality between women and men in respect of treatment and opportunities. </p>

 Mr President, let me thank the rapporteur, Mrs Kauppi, and all others who have committed themselves to this work. A major problem which I would like to highlight in the work on equality is that too many people today believe that we have equal opportunities. That is sometimes true in theory, but we have a long way to go when it comes to equal opportunities in practice. This resolution draws attention to this fact and puts forward good proposals on what can be done and what in fact must be done now.</p>
<p class="contents">I have, in this Parliament too, repeatedly demanded and highlighted the need for statistics broken down by sex in all areas. Only when we see the facts can we bring about change. If we cannot, by revealing the facts, document the great differences which exist between the sexes, they will be ignored. Besides, people do not realise how extensive they really are. It is therefore a self-evident demand which I repeat: all statistics must be broken down by sex.</p>
<p class="contents">I also want to highlight my great concern, and that of my political group as a whole, about the difference in employment between women and men as regards <span class="italic">paid</span>
 work; we all know that the unpaid work is done by women. At the same time as we see figures showing an increase in vacancies for women, we also see what type of employment is involved. The majority of the new jobs for women are casual, insecure part-time positions and low-wage jobs. We must put an end to this situation. </p>

Mr President, the report on equality between women and men is additional proof that equal rights policies have an important role to play. Both women and men have the right to play an active part in all areas of public life and have the right to have this enshrined in law. Dignity is not, however, experienced just through legislative acts, but also through appropriate levels of material, spiritual and emotional support, especially within a healthy family structure.</p>
<p class="contents">Unfortunately contemporary propaganda devalues the role of marriage, the family and the mother and instils a feeling of guilt in those girls and women who want to stay at home and look after children. Instead of providing assistance, legal protection, instead of valuing the role of the wife and the mother bringing up children, there is an objectification of women, they are overloaded with expectations, and this is compounded by widely propagated views concerning contraception, abortion, extreme individualism, conflict between parents and children and even by extending retirement age, which leads to mental and physical breakdown.</p>
<p class="contents">It is important constantly to remind people that equality, equal rights of women and men, does not mean being the same as men. All forms of masculinisation of women, competing with men on every level, impoverishes not just women, but also society as a whole, and it distorts the richness and inner value of both femininity and masculinity.</p>
<p class="contents">Particular sensitivity is needed today to avoid actions that are divorced from people’s real needs and aspirations and to overcome the excesses of individualism and moral relativism. It is vital, especially in situations where there is no basic infrastructure for economic growth, to combat discrimination in many areas of life. For this reason, social organisations as well as laws should provide assistance in fulfilling our obligations, instead of indoctrination and unification that create unrest and conflict. This is why I am calling for the dignity of every human being to be respected, not just with regard to equal pay, but also as regards respect for traditions, cultures, religions and values that are important to national and cultural identity, which will enrich contemporary Europe. </p>

Mr President, colleagues, the report before us today is largely an exercise in stating the obvious. In it we find the same familiar statistics concerning employment rates, wage gaps and types of job. We also find never-ending descriptions of the persistence of gender-based stereotypes and the resulting discrimination reflected in women’s absence from certain sectors of the labour market. I am thinking in particular of advanced technology, the sciences, research and engineering.</p>
<p class="contents">Yet the report contains an apparent contradiction. How can we welcome globalisation in paragraph 17 – hailing its positive effects on women’s access to education, care, health and employment, whether at home, in sub-contracting or in micro-enterprises – and at the same time, in paragraph 18, highlight the negative impact of globalisation with the feminisation of poverty? Which paragraph are we to take seriously?</p>
<p class="contents">Elsewhere the report recommends pan-European measures to increase awareness of zero tolerance for sexist insults. But what constitutes a sexist insult? Was Ségolène Royal, who contested the last French presidential election, the victim of a sexist insult when one of her former Socialist comrades said she was not the best candidate for the highest office in the land? Or was that no more than a criticism, or simply an opinion?</p>
<p class="contents">It is dangerous to base legislation on a notion like this that has no legal definition and cannot have one. Moreover, we are dealing here with an area that is essentially subjective and non-rational. </p>

 Ladies and gentlemen, once again we are getting annoyed about statistics demonstrating that although women achieve better results, their salaries are permanently 15% lower. Yes, we have a glass ceiling and men do not like women taking up senior posts very much. Stereotypes exist and women themselves sometimes become their victims. We want to change this. However, my opinion is that if we want to change something we have to start here.</p>
<p class="contents">The employment statistics for the European Parliament and for the Commission clearly show that men are in an overwhelming majority when it comes to the best-paid posts. Women prevail in the lowest-paid posts. There are many highly efficient female linguists with third-level education who work here for the salary of a secretary. Their better-paid bosses have mostly two types of qualification: they are men and they have been here a long time.</p>
<p class="contents">Ladies and gentlemen, I am of the opinion that recommendations by the European institutions on gender issues will be taken seriously only when we carry out a thorough analysis of the relation between reward systems and people’s education and efficiency, and when human resources management and pay systems are revised. Until this happens, the citizens will see us as people who preach water and drink wine. </p>

Mr President, we are celebrating both the 50<span class="sup">th</span>
 anniversary of the founding treaty of a United Europe and 50 years of progress in guaranteeing equality between men and women. The culmination of the latter is the horizontal reference to this in all spheres of action of the European Commission and of dialogue with civil society.</p>
<p class="contents">Hidden inequalities between men and women continue to exist in the policies and practices of the EU Member States. We need analysis and assessment of the negative circumstances that give rise to these inequalities. The report by my dear colleague, Mrs Kauppi, whom I congratulate, lists many actions to counter partial discrimination against women.</p>
<p class="contents">I would like particularly to emphasise the measures to promote equal participation by men and women in support of the family as a basic factor in economic development, prosperity and the social cohesion of the EU. Gender equality ought to benefit those women who voluntarily wish to remain at home, for a long or a short time, in order to look after children, the elderly and dependants. The fact that these women have been out of work should not expose them to discrimination over pensions and social welfare rights.</p>
<p class="contents">Commissioner, I am very disappointed with the position of Greek women. According to press reports, you have brought infringement proceedings against my country to eliminate the more flexible age conditions applying to women. Why cannot an early award of pensions for daughters and mothers be an exchange for what they contribute to their families?</p>
<p class="contents">Equality – yes, Commissioner, but not balance. The Member States, the EU and the social partners can make good use of the newly-created European Alliance for Families: best practices and pioneering approaches for policies that are family-friendly can be promoted. They will keep pace with national policies and thus promote equality.</p>
<p class="contents">The EU’s demographic problem demands that equal opportunities be granted to men and women. With regard to parental leave, the relevant directive agreed upon solely between the Commission and the social partners requires revision, and you have promised, Commissioner, that this revision will take place in 2008.</p>
<p class="contents">However, a commitment by the private sector to employ young women and with regard to the sacking of young mothers is also required. The productivity and development of the EU, Commissioner, require the creation of a mechanism to monitor discrimination of this kind. We hope that you will take immediate action. </p>

Mr President, Commissioner, ladies and gentlemen, I can assure Mrs Kauppi of the full support of our Socialist Group on all the points she addressed in her report. The equality report is appearing during the year of equal opportunities for all, and we can also mark 50 years of equality policy in the European Union. Unless pressure is exerted and things change, women will no longer trust the European Union.</p>
<p class="contents">It was also announced that the year 2007 would see the setting up of the European Institute for Gender Equality. What is the situation as regards appointments to the Board? Here our Parliament has a right of say. Where are preparations actually under way to ensure that the Vilnius institute can become operational before the year is out?</p>
<p class="contents">The EU has not made use of its key competences in the field of equal pay – a major area, which has been addressed by many female colleagues. I find it scandalous that 15% of women are still paid less for their work than men. Sweden is the only country where things look better, with a figure of just 10%. In my country, Germany, the figure is 26%, and I am no longer prepared to tolerate that. This is a case where the Commission has to muster up the courage to exert pressure on the Member States.</p>
<p class="contents">Reconciling professional and family life: Mr Špidla has taken measures in that area. I am glad. We support the fact that fathers are also having to do their share. Undertakings also bear great responsibility here. That is why our Group has launched a Europe-wide campaign of support.</p>
<p class="contents">We want a qualitative and quantitative evaluation of measures we take under, for instance, the Structural Funds. A recent hearing in the Committee on Regional Development showed that hardly any account has been taken to date of the fact that women benefit far less from the EU budget than men. Gender budgeting is, therefore, another key demand of ours.</p>
<p class="contents">The Commission has announced measures in two areas: the implementation of legislative measures to combat multiple discrimination and to combat violence against women. We have scarcely touched on that today, but it is a burning issue that needs to be resolved. </p>

I would like to thank the rapporteur for raising an important issue once again. I do not think that we are bursting through an open door with this report. The door may well already be open, but if there is a glass ceiling above us then we must address this issue over and over again.</p>
<p class="contents">In my speech I would like to focus on two points. Especially when considering the fact that a policy implementing equal rights for both sexes is an important means of achieving economic development.</p>
<p class="contents">Despite the existence <span class="italic">de jure </span>
of equal rights in all European Union countries, <span class="italic">de facto </span>
inequality persists in the division between men and women of power and access to economic, social and cultural resources. This is down to the continuance of prevailing customs and their influence on the unequal division of family responsibilities and the obstacles to combining work and family life which exist for most women. This, I am sorry to say, is evidence of the democratic deficit at European level.</p>
<p class="contents">Equal participation by both sexes in decision-making is the prime prerequisite for democracy, so I shall now comment on decision-making in all walks of life. Liberals say that people’s right to make a decision themselves is the key to success. Freedom to choose, however, is attained only if women and men can make their own choices in all areas. In order for men and women, I repeat, men and women, to be able to combine work and family, we need good-quality childcare facilities, family-friendly work environments and a supportive legal framework.</p>
<p class="contents">In addition, it is important to improve both the legal and non-legal framework and to raise the level of awareness in society. The same is also true of outdated patterns of thought, in other words women must change from being participants into decision-makers; only then will we be able to talk of a society where the interests of both sexes are represented and considered, a society which is truly democratic. </p>

Mr President, Commissioner, Mrs Kauppi, ladies and gentlemen, this year we celebrated the 50th anniversary of the founding of the EU and we can also look back over 50 years of milestones with regard to equality between women and men. Yet I find the findings of the Commission’s 2007 equality report a bitter pill to swallow. It shows that in many areas people are still only paying lip service to gender equality, and that it remains far from being a reality.</p>
<p class="contents">We have heard many statistics quoted today – there are wide differences in the employment rates of men and women, and in many Member States women have, with few exceptions, a higher rate of unemployment. Almost one in three women work part-time. We know that women are still significantly under-represented in positions of power and leadership. It is indeed a scandal that the average wage gap is 15%, rising to as much as 27% in Germany.</p>
<p class="contents">I am also glad that the Commission has addressed the question of obligatory parental leave for fathers. It was quite obvious that the question of reconciling family and work belongs on the Commission’s agenda. Yet in other areas of EU equality policy, the Commission seems to have switched to neutral. I say that because we have not heard any political initiatives, aside from the aforesaid parental leave for fathers, from the Commission.</p>
<p class="contents">The Institute for Gender Equality was mentioned, as was violence against women. What is the Commission doing to tackle the wage gap? I hear little more than rhetoric. It is our duty to do far more there, including gender budgeting, which has been heralded for years, but where are the indicators? So I would ask the Commission to propose ambitious legislation so that gender equality policy becomes a beacon again in the EU. </p>

 Mr President, my thanks and compliments to Mrs Kauppi on her report, but I have a few points to make to the Commission. The Commission regularly pays lip service to gender equality, and has done so again today, but time and time again it has failed in practice to turn its good intentions into concrete action. Worse still, instead of taking measures which would reduce gender inequality, combat female poverty and help women resolve the day-to-day problems they encounter, the Commission’s policy frequently makes their position even more difficult.</p>
<p class="contents">A good example of this is ‘flexisecurity’, measures to make the laws on redundancy more flexible. If the proposals outlined by the Commission in its Green Paper are implemented it is precisely women, who all too often are employed under short-term contracts as temps and are relatively poorly paid, who will suffer. It is women, specifically, who have a lot of problems with things like building up a pension fund, health costs and juggling family care and paid work. And what does the Commission do? Instead of giving women, indeed workers in general, the certainty which would make their lives a little bit easier, the Commission proposes to create even greater uncertainty.</p>
<p class="contents">This report on inequality between men and women shows that major differences still persist in 2007. A much higher priority needs to be given to overcoming this, in both word and deed. Gender equality should be automatically mainstreamed into all Commission policy. I actually find it deplorable that we have to keep on reminding the Commission of the fact. </p>

 Mr President, I see from this report that there is to be no relief from this programme of spending our money to promote gender awareness, interfering in business hiring decisions and forcing firms to offer flexible working and generous leave arrangements, but nowhere do I see any recognition of side effects. There is no understanding that much of this social engineering is largely self-defeating.</p>
<p class="contents">The simple logic, like it or not, is that if it costs more to hire women, then fewer women will be hired, despite the rules that prevent employers from mentioning gender in job advertisements and interviews. All legislation designed to prevent discrimination against women, or old people, or minorities, has the undesirable result of demeaning those who would have achieved without the legislation.</p>
<p class="contents">All our jobs, for women and men, depend on the wealth generated by the economy. Most jobs are provided by small businesses. Well, unlike in this Parliament, out there in the real world of small business, women and men are employed and they earn money by producing goods and services that other people are happy to pay for. This obsession with promoting gender equality is just one of many sources of interference in small business. If we continue to add more cost and more restrictions, then business will hire less and pay less. In the end we might be more equal, but we shall all be poorer, both women and men. </p>

Mr President, I would like to congratulate Mrs Kauppi. We all agree on the need to increase the birth rate in Europe in order to improve the demographic situation. If this is successful, and it has to be successful, it will mean that a significant number of women, especially young women, will have to leave the job market at least temporarily. This is a problem, as already there is a shortage of workers in many parts of Europe.</p>
<p class="contents">For example, science in Europe is experiencing a shortfall of about 700 000 scientists. Despite this, in Europe barely one doctor in four is a woman, and only one out of ten professors. This is in a situation where, in Europe, more women than men are completing higher education. This means that they are well prepared for academic work, but they interrupt this work and do not continue with it.</p>
<p class="contents">In each sector the incentives and facilities offered to women to take up work have to be different. For example, in education there are a number of simple steps. First of all, the possibility of doing academic work at home. Secondly, organisation of very comfortable and affordable nurseries within the walls of institutes or universities. Thirdly, childcare either by men or by women. Fourthly, the possibility of obtaining academic degrees during maternity leave. Finally, fifthly, making sure that men and women earn the same for the same job.</p>
<p class="contents">Europe cannot allow a situation to continue where educated and skilled women lose out in academic areas just because they give birth to children. Fortunately someone has become involved in this area.</p>
<p class="contents">UNESCO, together with L’Oréal, has for some years been running a project for women in the academic sector. We shall see the results, the very good results, of this project, in an exhibition opening next Monday, 1 October, in the European Parliament in Brussels, on the ground floor, opposite the KBC bank. I would like to extend a warm invitation to all of you to attend. </p>

 In 2005 in my report on the Lisbon Strategy from a gender perspective, I pointed to various forms of discrimination affecting European women.</p>
<p class="contents">Two years later, after many discussions and good intentions, many debates and conferences, many reports and many studies, what has changed? What progress has been made as regards the wage gap between men and women, the participation of women in the decision-making process, or as regards the reconciliation of work, family and privates lives for both men and women? Although there has been progress in some Member States, regrettably little has changed at European level.</p>
<p class="contents">The gender pay gap continues to average around 15% and the participation of women in decision-making has risen by only 1%. Women continue to devote three times as many hours to family responsibilities as men. Nevertheless, the number of women at universities is increasing. They are gradually asserting themselves but there are still many forms of discrimination, especially when they become mothers and precisely for that reason. Perhaps this is why birth rates are so low. Women migrants and refugees, women belonging to ethnic minorities, elderly women, women with disabilities, all these groups face dual discrimination.</p>
<p class="contents">We need better laws, such as the equality laws that were approved in Spain and Portugal, but we also need compliance with existing laws, especially the laws on advertising so as to eliminate the degrading depiction of women in advertising and the mass media. We need to change the law in order to change attitudes. We need fewer words and more results. </p>

 Mr President, ladies and gentlemen, the issue of equal opportunities for women and men is still relevant in the EU. Few changes were made in 2006. Women’s salaries still remain 15 percent lower than men’s salaries in the EU. Women returning to the labour market or climbing the career ladder face significant problems.</p>
<p class="contents">The Council Directive of 1975 on the approximation of the laws of the Member States relating to the application of the principle of equal pay for men and women has not yet been implemented. The Member States do not show any political will to solve the problems of gender equality and integration in the work-place. Therefore, I agree with the report’s proposal that the Commission should carry out a study on how Member States implement Community legislation in the area of equality and take appropriate action in the event that it is not implemented.</p>
<p class="contents">Speaking of integration in the work-place, I would like to emphasise the importance of good practice and its dissemination, especially in improving the possibilities for women to participate in politics and the political decision-making process. My country, Lithuania, has experience in this. The Commission and effective use of the European Social Fund can contribute to the dissemination of such practice. </p>

I not an advocate of extreme feminism nor do I believe that democracy should be blind to gender and I therefore welcome this own-initiative report by Mrs Kauppi, on which I sincerely congratulate her.</p>
<p class="contents">The problem of balancing entitlement to a professional career and family responsibilities is an acute one that also covers maternal, parental and paternal leave. In view of the changed conditions in a globalised world we should, also at European Parliament level, encourage the Member States to modernise these systems. On the initiative of young families, it might be beneficial for Member States to consider introducing benefits during maternity leave for at least 12 months at a rate of 100% of income and during parental leave for at least 24 months at a rate of at least 50% of income, where mothers or, as the case may be, fathers look after their children on a full-time basis.</p>
<p class="contents">The period of maternity and parenthood is always referred to in legal language as leave despite the fact that not only mothers but also psychologists, doctors, sociologists and many other experts agree with parents that being on maternity or parental leave in no way constitutes leave. I believe that the time has come to start with the language used to speak about maternity and parenthood and to refer to maternity leave in more correct terms. When the gap in their active working lives is over, it is necessary to facilitate the unimpeded return of mothers and fathers to the labour market and the continuation of their professional careers.</p>
<p class="contents">I consider it important to emphasise the need for training during parental leave in order to deal with the changed demands of employment and to consolidate key areas of knowledge, such as the spirit of enterprise and the adoption of a scientific and technological approach. Structural Funds could also be used to that end in the regions. I believe that our society must place much greater value on maternity and parenthood. Parents have an extremely responsible role in the formation of society: the children they raise will shape Europe as a whole.</p>
<p class="contents">At the same time, these measures would enable many more women to dedicate themselves to a more demanding career, such as an academic career, in addition to bringing up their children. </p>

 Mr President, Commissioner, it is somewhat dispiriting to stand here and speak on a report about inequality in the European Union in 2007. It should not be needed. It should be self-evident, not least in view of the fact that the EU has a majority of women. But the sad fact is that it is needed. It is vitally important to get men out onto the field of play, to get them to score goals. Otherwise the game is lost. Here are a few passes to men: the rate of employment for women must increase. They must have the right to full-time employment and the possibility of part-time employment. The pay gap must be closed. Are women in the EU really worth <span class="italic">15% less</span>
 than men? Women must have a greater presence in the boardroom, in politics and in industry. Fathers must take more responsibility for the home and family and must take their share of parental leave, not least for the sake of the children.</p>
<p class="contents">There are many important things which Parliament has to urge the Commission and the Member States to do. Let us hope that they listen and take action! </p>

 I sincerely congratulate Mrs Kauppi on this very good report, which is the result of close cooperation with all members of the Committee on Women’s Rights and Gender Equality.</p>
<p class="contents">The rapporteur has underlined very well the importance of implementing a policy of equality between men and women as part of the Lisbon Strategy. One of the objectives of the Lisbon Agenda is to increase the number of women working and in employment. At the same time, however, we are incapable of formally recognising the informal work carried out by women that is unpaid. We know women who work to ensure solidarity between generations, who act as volunteers and who create tolerable conditions for social relationships. However, this informal work is unpaid. We do not wish to recognise it officially because we do not see the money that circulates around it. In my view, this logic constitutes a form a discrimination against women. I believe that it might a matter of <span class="italic">Realpolitik</span>
 for our friend Mr Špidla to recognise the informal unpaid work of women. That would also resolve the many problems experienced by minorities, which we spoke about a moment ago.</p>
<p class="contents">To help us make progress on this issue, in Europe and around the world we have individuals and institutes that offer us mathematical and statistical models and the means of applying them in our policies. Among them is Gary Beck, the Nobel Prize Laureate in Economics, to whom reference has already been made several times.</p>
<p class="contents">Mr President, Commissioner, ladies and gentlemen, I have taken this opportunity to draw attention to the real problem of equality between men and women. </p>

Mr President, the time has come for Member States finally to take decisive steps to eliminate outdated models of behaviour and decision-making, particularly in administration, in order to pay more attention to the issue of gender in all policies.</p>
<p class="contents">Differences in the treatment of men and women still exist. They result, for example, in low incomes and discrimination against pregnant women and young mothers. Even though it is a promising sign, as regards employment of women, that, since 2000, 6 out of the 8 million new jobs created in the European Union have gone to women, the difference in pay between men and women in the European Union still averages 15% and, in some countries, is as high as 30%.</p>
<p class="contents">It is unacceptable that women, just because of motherhood, which is a responsibility of both parents, should be treated worse than men in the labour market, which then affects their career, income and, later on, pension payments. The stereotypes concerning gender have to be overcome and it is for this reason that I am in favour of the proposal to create a budget line, within the framework of cohesion policy, dedicated to financing measures aimed at promoting equal opportunities and at financing research on the effects of political strategies on women’s lives.</p>
<p class="contents">I would like to offer my sincere congratulations to Mrs Kauppi for an excellent report. </p>

 Mr. President, Ladies and Gentlemen, I believe the time has come for the European Union to properly finance the noble goals described by the Treaty, such as combating gender discrimination or achieving equal pay for women and men.</p>
<p class="contents">The report we debate on presents one of the main opportunities open to gender equality by means of the European Union budget. It consists of structural and cohesion funds, a level at which one must see a facilitation of women's access to European resources. According to the data we possess, following the latest European Union enlargement, women have had comparatively less to gain from the regional and cohesion policy funds, and this should be corrected.</p>
<p class="contents">Nevertheless, it is not enough to analyze only the regional and cohesion policy funds, although their weight in the Union’s budget – almost 36% – forces us to fight in order for them to reach as many women as possible.</p>
<p class="contents">We also need to see what the latest developments in the traditional gender policy programmes of the European Union are, such as PROGRESS, Daphne or EQUAL. Although, this year, both the PROGRESS programme, on the whole, and section 5, devoted to gender equality, benefit from additional funds, in relative terms, in 2008 the budget line for equality is smaller than in the previous year.</p>
<p class="contents">The Daphne programme for combating domestic violence has obtained excellent results so far and the European Commission has seen this and recommended a budget increase as compared to 2007. Both for these two programmes, and for the EQUAL programme, the Council operated reductions as compared to the amounts proposed by the Commission in the preliminary draft budget. Moreover, the Council proposed a 7.5% decrease in the funds designed for the new gender institute, a completely unjustified decrease for a European institution that is just starting up.</p>
<p class="contents">Unfortunately, we continue to notice that the Council’s political will to materialize the European strategies for equality of chances, for budgetary allocation, is still lacking. This is why the Parliament, as a branch of the budgetary authority, must compensate this deficit and provide consistency to the European Union’s gender policy. </p>

 Mr President, I too would like to thank the rapporteur for an excellent and very balanced report. A number of points have already been touched on. As a member of the Committee on Women’s Rights and of the Agriculture Committee, I shall concern myself primarily with the position of women in agriculture.</p>
<p class="contents">What strikes one first is the invisibility of many women working in the agricultural sector. Women hold 40% of all agricultural jobs, but many official statistics, including those of Eurostat, Commissioner, only look at either female employees or female employers. They take no account of assisting spouses, even though those women make up the largest category of labour on the many family farms of north-west Europe. Their contribution to the business is significant and they often help too to develop the activities of the farm and of the countryside. So I urge Eurostat to make this large group of women show up in the official statistics. I urge the Commission to take account of this large category of female labour in its policy-making.</p>
<p class="contents">Moreover, it is precisely this category of working partners who encounter practical day-to-day problems in some Member States, for example in building up pension rights, in accessing social security, if their farm ceases operation, if they get divorced, and if they need to take sick leave or maternity leave, though I am happy to say that in the Netherlands action is being taken to remedy this situation. I would draw the Commission’s attention to the project ‘<span class="italic">Je verdiende loon</span>
’ (‘It’s yours by right’), launched in my country with ESF aid to highlight the obstacles which these partners face. I hope the Commission will take its conclusions into account when framing future policy, so that, thanks to this essential female workforce, we can continue to have strong European agriculture and a viable countryside. </p>

 Mr. President, dear colleagues, since 2000, out of the 8 million new jobs, 6 million have been held by women. We might think that, truly, the time of equality of chances or even of the positive discrimination of women in the gender relations has come. Nevertheless, we cannot say this because the reality of these new jobs, of the 6 million women, contradicts us.</p>
<p class="contents">We cannot truly handle the risk of aging and demographic decrease that Europe and the Member States are dealing with today, if most of the employment for women has been precarious, part-time or poorly paid. The salary difference in Europe remains 15% in favour of women.</p>
<p class="contents">Member States, in general, and Romania is no exception, will have to continue to invest in education free from gender stereotypes, to adopt clear policies that would conciliate the family and professional lives of women and men.</p>
<p class="contents">I would like to congratulate Ms Rapporteur for her extraordinary work and I truly believe that we need annual assessments of the results of actions included in the gender equality roadmap; we need a final agreement on subjects such as costs of maternity, parental leave, individualization of pension rights and the social security and taxation systems. </p>

Mr President, let me say first of all that the Commission very largely shares the concerns expressed by most of the speakers. Some of them – indeed virtually all of them – are calling for measures that the Commission is already taking.</p>
<p class="contents">As you know, the Commission has the task of monitoring the transposition and application of Community law on gender equality. In essence this entails initiating and following through infringement proceedings when it becomes aware that a Member State has failed to transpose one of the directives properly, or when a citizen makes a complaint to it about the inadequate transposition or application of a directive. So, in terms of proceedings for infringements of the directive on equal treatment for women and men, 18 letters were sent out in April 2007. The Commission is currently studying the replies, and a decision on the reasoned opinion is expected in December.</p>
<p class="contents">Let me deal quickly now with a few more detailed and specific issues. With regard to the establishment of the European Institute for Gender Equality in Vilnius, the Management Board met in October and recruitment of the director is under way.</p>
<p class="contents">Turning to the initiatives on the gender pay gap, many of the Members who spoke highlighted the differential in wages and salaries – and rightly so. Our response on this question is set out in the communication. In 2008 the Commission will undertake an analysis of current legislation to determine whether it is adequate and to identify any necessary changes.</p>
<p class="contents">With regard to the question of women in rural areas, self-employed women working in agriculture are already covered by Directive 86/613/EEC. The Commission has just begun studying this legislation to see whether it is effective and to pinpoint what needs to be changed.</p>
<p class="contents">That brings me finally to a more ideological question, but one to which I want to respond, concerning flexisecurity. The purpose of flexisecurity is to increase flexibility in the labour market – not to increase insecurity – while at the same time creating greater choice in the market by giving workers additional means of adapting, for example through training or steps to reconcile their private and working lives. </p>

 From the point of view of ensuring gender equality, I think it is vital to have comprehensive, systematic and objective information, including access to harmonised Community statistical data that are as broad and as up to date as possible. In this regard I also think the annual reports in which the Commission presents the situation of men and women are particularly important.</p>
<p class="contents">The Community has done a great deal to expand the legal basis for gender equality, but whether this has brought results in practice is another matter. The annual report answers this question to some extent. I think it would be important to have systematic monitoring of practical progress with the strategic targets set out in the 2006-10 Roadmap for equality between women and men, to check that Member States are implementing the legislation in practice, and to review integration of gender mainstreaming into Community policy and the gender impact of various projects.</p>
<p class="contents">Since the future of the European Union will largely depend on how we manage to attract more women into work, we need to devote specific, detailed and focused attention to examining women’s participation in the labour market and ways of mobilising it, to eliminating the obstacles that prevent women from finding employment, progressing in their career, or maintaining work and family life in tandem, and to examining the situation of disadvantaged women (migrants, ethnic minorities, lone parents). </p>

 Article 141 of the EC Treaty states that ‘Each Member State shall ensure that the principle of equal pay for male and female workers for equal work or work of equal value is applied.’</p>
<p class="contents">This is a very important principle and we must ensure that it is being implemented in every country.</p>
<p class="contents">I believe the time has come to take another step forward.</p>
<p class="contents">In Malta we have several situations in which persons, both female and male, are paid according to different rates and systems, despite the fact that they do the same work. These different payments are being justified on the basis of bureaucratic criteria, such as the year in which these persons were employed.</p>
<p class="contents">If such discrimination occurs between two women or two men, there is no violation of the EC Treaty in its strict interpretation.</p>
<p class="contents">Similar situations exist and are evident in the public sector and elsewhere.</p>
<p class="contents">For this reason there is a need for both the Commission and the governments of the Member States to take new initiatives to ensure that one simple principle is applied: equal pay for equal work, whoever you may be. </p>

Mr President, ladies and gentlemen, we specifically state in this resolution that EUFOR is to be considered as a bridging force with a temporary mandate, to be replaced by a successor mission. The letter of 21 September from the Government of Chad does not, however, make it clear whether the Government will give its consent to that. Hence the following supplementary amendment to paragraph 3(h): </p>
<p class="contents">‘a clear commitment by the government of Chad prior to the start of the EUFOR deployment is needed to accept the assessment of the international community with regard to the necessity of a successor mission.’ </p>
<p class="contents">The text then continues. </p>

Mr President, I think this amendment is superfluous in the light of the letter received by the United Nations from the Government of Chad on 11 September 2007, expressing the Government’s agreement. I have here a photocopy of the letter and I quote: ‘the Government of Chad welcomes the new recommendations of the Secretary-General of the United Nations, contained in his report of 10 August 2007, with a view to the deployment of an international presence in eastern Chad in order to contribute [...]’ and so on and so forth.</p>
<p class="contents">The amendment thus serves no purpose. The agreement is in writing and is accessible to anyone who wishes to read it. I am quite taken aback because I sent a copy of the text to Mr Gahler. I therefore propose that we vote against the amendment. </p>

Naturally I have the text here, and the crucial point is: </p>
<p class="contents">‘after six months the Government of Chad will assess the initial outcome of this presence with a view to a possible succession to the European Union operation by other contingents within the framework of the United Nations and with the consent of Chad’. </p>
<p class="contents">That means Chad can veto it. If the Government does not consent, it will not happen. That is why I propose adding that Chad must accept the assessment of the international community and cannot apply a veto.</p>

 Mr President, I agree with Mr Van Orden and the others – having regard also to the presence of Mr Wang Yingfan and the delegation – that this House should send out an emphatic signal. In relation to paragraph 5, however, we would request amending the text as follows, because after looking at what has occurred in the past in the Security Council we are not sure we drafted the text quite carefully enough. It is because we want to be very precise that we ask that paragraph 5 be reworded as follows: </p>
<p class="contents">‘Asks China fully to support a clear statement of the United Nations Security Council condemning the use of brutal force’</p>
<p class="contents">It remains to be seen whether the veto has already been applied, but we do ask the House to agree that we need a clear condemnation from the Security Council and that China should support it. </p>

Mr President, our Group had also wanted to table an oral amendment, but I think we can agree a joint approach here. According to my information, China has already voted against, and not just China but also the other permanent member of the Security Council, Russia. That is why I would agree to take up the wording of Martin Schulz’s amendment, so as to put China and Russia on the spot. </p>

Thank you for allowing me to take the floor and thank you, Mrs Descamps, for your report, which moves forward the process of digitising libraries in the European Union.</p>
<p class="contents">I voted to support the proposed document because the process of digitising book stocks, film recordings, and audio and video recordings currently under way in all Member States is slow and fragmented. I consider it necessary to focus attention on coordinating these national initiatives and above all on preserving digital material. At European level it is necessary to devote significant attention to preserving digital copies. The creation of a digital copy of a book or a film is not necessarily a guarantee of its long-term preservation.</p>
<p class="contents">All digital material, whether a digitised work or original digital material, must be kept in such a way that it is permanently accessible. We have little experience of digital conservation. In the absence of a consistent strategy, mere digitisation may lead to depreciation of the investment made. </p>

I voted in favour of the very sound report by my esteemed colleague Marie-Hélène Descamps on the creation of a European digital library to make our cultural and scientific heritage universally accessible in all the European languages.</p>
<p class="contents">As I write, I wish to pay tribute to the former French President Jacques Chirac, who – with five other European Union heads of state – took the initiative on this project in April 2005. I am glad that the European Parliament is signalling strongly to the Commission that it should make this project a priority. I am also pleased to see possible solutions emerging to the operational problems: coordination of all Europe’s existing digital libraries, public access, and cooperation with the various stakeholders in the sector, particularly writers, publishers and bookshops, for example.</p>
<p class="contents">This is a tool that deserves our support, for it will help to combat ignorance and thus to promote democracy, peace and prosperity. Well done, Marie-Hélène Descamps! </p>

 This report concerns the European Commission Recommendation of 24 August 2006 calling on the Member States to coordinate their efforts to achieve synergy at European level in the field of digitisation, and proposing the creation of a European digital library in the form of a common multilingual access point to the European cultural heritage. On 13 November 2006 the Council unanimously adopted these recommendations.</p>
<p class="contents">The European Parliament approved the Recommendation but made a series of proposals aimed at clarification, bearing in mind the range of problems that can arise, for example during work on the conceptual and technical organisation of all the categories of cultural material, as regards the various stages which need to be borne in mind and the potential provided by out-of-copyright text material.</p>
<p class="contents">Although we might harbour doubts about various proposals included in the resolution of the European Parliament, we voted in favour of the concept whilst pointing out the need to protect copyright, defend linguistic and cultural diversity, achieve solidarity and economic and social cohesion, in order to ensure that an interesting idea does not become yet another source of discrimination and social exclusion. </p>

I voted in favour of the excellent own-initiative report by my Czech colleague Thomáš Zatloukal on efficiency and equity in European education and training systems, drafted in response to a European Commission communication.</p>
<p class="contents">Lifelong education and training are essential, as is the goal of establishing a European qualifications framework for lifelong learning, which will facilitate recognition of educational achievement and allow visible, transparent switching between different study options. I am also in favour of introducing a culture of appraisal in education and training systems, with reliable measurements.</p>
<p class="contents">Investment in lifelong education and training is of central importance for social cohesion and will give people the skills they need to adapt more effectively to the various changes in their lives. I support all the report’s proposals in respect of the different levels of education: pre-school, primary, secondary, university and vocational. </p>

We voted against this report, even though we noted several positive elements in it, because we disagree with its general line of argument and with some of the positions taken in it, whether concerning the aims of further education or fees, sidestepping the fact that the problems of disadvantaged groups cannot be resolved merely by offering financial incentives such as those announced for Portugal. This is not the way to reduce inequity in terms of access to university education.</p>
<p class="contents">Even taking the arguments of the rapporteur that education influences economic growth by ‘increasing human capital and innovative capability’, and taking the view that by increasing the effectiveness of education and training, individuals and society as a whole can obtain a return on their investment of up to 8% per annum, we can see what countries stand to lose if they do not invest decisively in further education which is accessible to all sections of the population.</p>
<p class="contents">According to recent studies, 75 million EU citizens – in other words 32% of the workforce – receive inadequate education. In 2010 only 15% of new jobs will be open to that group of people, who come mostly from the least-favoured sectors of society. Hence the need to ensure equal access to education. </p>

 The majority in this Parliament need to be regularly reminded that education policy in the European Union is a national matter.</p>
<p class="contents">This report from the Committee on Culture and Education of the European Parliament takes up a number of matters for the EU institutions to work on which have nothing whatsoever to do with them. For example, paragraph 12 of the draft report proposes that the European Parliament adopt the position ‘that more research into pre-school education is necessary at the EU level, in particular in the field of early and targeted actions in order to identify the practices which produce the expected effects’.</p>
<p class="contents">The draft text of paragraph 48 reads: ‘[The European Parliament] believes that in order to better target EU action it would be necessary to develop a process, based on reports periodically submitted by Member States as well as on independent verification, to appraise the performance of education and training systems in the EU, paying particular attention to the acquisition of basic skills by pupils and to the achievement of equity objectives’.</p>
<p class="contents">All this is an attempt to interfere in areas of competence which are the prerogative of the Member States. The subsidiarity principle is cast aside as usual, and institutional competition in this important field is undermined. We therefore vote against this report. </p>

Mr President, I am voting in favour of the report by Mr Zatloukal on efficiency and equity in European education and training systems.</p>
<p class="contents">Vocational education and training policies have a significant positive impact on economic and social outcomes, on balanced growth and social cohesion. Low efficiency and unequal access result in high hidden costs – reduced tax revenue, increased requirements for health care and support from public funds, as well as the costs associated with a higher level of antisocial behaviour.</p>
<p class="contents">In the conclusions of the Lisbon European Council of March 2000, emphasis was put on education as the key to growth in the European economy and society.</p>
<p class="contents">This report presents sensible ideas concerning methods to reinstate effective teaching in primary and secondary schools as well as in universities.</p>
<p class="contents">What is also important is the appeal contained in the report, calling on governments in Member States to carry out long-term planning for educational priorities at national and local levels. </p>

 The report has many good ideas on how to reduce social exclusion etc., but then it spoils everything by speaking of how university fees can serve as a financial incentive! Worst of all is its preoccupation with ‘effectiveness’, ‘competitiveness’ and ‘higher standards of performance’. What happened to creativity, capacity for critical examination and independent thinking? The EU wants conformist production units geared to consumption and production. Fortunately the EU does not have power over education, and so it should remain. I will vote against the report. </p>

Mr President, despite the fact that 129 countries have abolished the death penalty, the scale on which this punishment is used throughout the world is still very worrying. In 2006 alone 1 591 people were executed; at least 3 861 people are currently sentenced to death. The European Union is the world leader in the fight against the death penalty. Abolition of the death penalty is a key human rights issue in the EU’s relations with non-EU countries at international fora, such as the UN. This political commitment goes hand in hand with significant financial support for projects implemented under the European Initiative for Democracy and Human Rights. In addition, abolition of the death penalty is accepted as being a condition for membership of the European Union and the Council of Europe.</p>
<p class="contents">It is therefore even more regrettable that Europe will not be celebrating the World Day against the Death Penalty on 10 October, owing to opposition from the Polish government. I would like to express my regret that this standpoint taken by the Polish government, as part of its pre-election strategy, will harm Poland’s image in the international arena and throughout the whole of the European Union, as regards the promotion of its basic values. The Decision of the Council as regards the death penalty memorandum and the idea of a joint resolution, which the Union will put forward at the next session of the UN General Assembly, are thoroughly deserving of support. </p>

Mr President, I would like to say that I voted against the resolution on the death penalty. I would like to emphasise that in my country, Poland, the death penalty was abolished 19 years ago.</p>
<p class="contents">However, it is one thing to be opposed to the death penalty, and quite another to support fundamentalist abolitionists, who base their opposition to any punishment of people for their crimes on a profound conviction that man is not responsible for his actions. I am convinced that people are responsible for their actions and should answer for them and should be punished for them, because they have free will.</p>
<p class="contents">The conviction of fundamentalist abolitionists, that people do not have and do not possess free will, and consequently cannot be punished, is essentially based on contempt for humanity and a false legacy of the French Revolution. </p>

 The death penalty violates the most fundamental of all rights – the right to life!</p>
<p class="contents">There are no studies whatsoever which can prove that the death penalty has a deterrent effect. The death penalty is inhumane, barbaric and utterly indefensible, and cannot be seen as anything other than an act of revenge. Thus the reason for the European Union’s insistence on renunciation of the death penalty as a condition for membership of the EU is self-evident. </p>

Under Article 24(2) of the Constitution of the Portuguese Republic, the death penalty shall not apply under any circumstances.</p>
<p class="contents">As we have often said, we agree with the move to present to the 62nd Session of the United Nations General Assembly a proposal for a resolution seeking the adoption of a universal moratorium on the death penalty – a moratorium which apparently already has the support of 95 countries – as being a step towards abolishing the death penalty.</p>
<p class="contents">Millions of men and women throughout the world long for the abolition of the death penalty, and an increasing number of countries have established a moratorium against its application or abolished it entirely in their internal legal order. As we have pointed out before, that step would be an advance for civilisation which it is important to extend to other countries. Our initiative can help in this connection.</p>

 The worldwide abolition of the death penalty would be a clear sign of progress for mankind. Clearly other horrors are being perpetrated, notably by countries who kill even without establishing guilt, but acceptance of the death penalty reflects a philosophical concept which should be eradicated from our societies. Therefore the proposal for a moratorium to end the death penalty deserves our support and the commitment of the EU Member States. In this connection, a World Day against the Death Penalty could have the effect of ‘embarrassing’ those States who resort to it and would therefore be beneficial.</p>
<p class="contents">As for the idea of a European Day against the Death Penalty, it seems to me that this is an attempt to hold a European celebration of something that does not exist in Europe whilst, as we know, it also raises other issues about which there is no unanimity. For that reason, I am doubtful of the virtue of this initiative.</p>
<p class="contents">Finally, I would not want this culture of the sanctity of life to be extended to other areas and other matters in which it also seems to me that the protection of life is a mark of civilisation. </p>

I welcome the European Parliament’s commitment to the deployment of a European force in Chad and the Central African Republic, in order to put an end to violence against the civilian populations there and to create conditions for the voluntary return of the hundreds of thousands of refugees and displaced persons. Already, the Darfur conflict is spilling across national borders, but, with the deployment of the mixed United Nations and African Union force in the days ahead, it could become impossible to halt the infectious spread of violence in the neighbouring countries.</p>
<p class="contents">That is why the European force is crucial to the overall scheme for restoring security and promoting reconciliation in the region. It will achieve its aims, however, only if all the parties to the conflict ‘play the game’ of peacemaking. This calls for observance of at least two conditions, on which I sought to insist in the drafting of the resolution. Firstly, the force should be absolutely neutral and impartial. Secondly, its internal composition should be balanced: France must not try to play the role of puppet master – and Nicolas Sarkozy’s attitude is not reassuring on that score.</p>
<p class="contents">With the other French Socialist Members of the House, I shall be particularly vigilant to ensure that the interests of Africa and Europe take priority in the territory for which France is responsible. </p>

Junilistan considers that a mandate from the UN is what is needed for a country or an intergovernmental organisation to send peacekeeping forces to conflict areas. We have in principle no objections to Member States joining together and sending troops under a peacekeeping mandate, provided that the operation is conducted under the flag of the UN and not of the EU.</p>
<p class="contents">It is, however, depressing that the prevailing situation in Chad and the Central African Republic is used as a pretext for the EU’s ambition to create a military strength at Union level. Foreign and security policy are and must remain strictly national concerns. </p>

 There is no doubt that this operation, which is clearly military in scope and conducted under the aegis of the UN, is aimed at consolidating the interventionist, militarist strategic concept of the CFSP/ESDP of the European Union.</p>
<p class="contents">For some, this military operation is going to be a real test of the so-called ‘credibility’ and operational effectiveness of the EU’s European Security and Defence Policy, in other words of its militarisation under the command and in accordance with the interests of its major powers.</p>
<p class="contents">The majority of the EP approves the ‘mandate’ for this military operation on the part of the EU, which includes the ‘use of force’ – within the meaning of Chapter VII of the UN Charter – in a region of Africa. This is an act of intervention involving a military ‘presence’ with neo-colonialist aims, a real act of war in a complex region where there are strong interests at stake, associated with the control of huge energy resources.</p>
<p class="contents">The real reasons underlying this great ‘interest’ in the region on the part of the major EU powers, notably France, are directly proportional to the results of prospection activities, which point to the existence of huge reserves of oil and other natural resources.</p>

 I voted for the resolution on Burma but I have serious reservations about its non-committal nature. We have to praise India for its support of reforms in Burma, and we have to adopt serious measures against China, which is blocking the United Nations mandate to begin negotiations with the military junta. China is one of the largest supporters of dictatorial regimes.</p>
<p class="contents">Because the Union imposed sanctions a long time ago, Burma’s economy now depends on China. I am therefore asking the Union to act on the threat of imposing sanctions against China, unless the country condemns the junta. If we are serious about the protection of human rights and democracy on a global scale, we must not hesitate. China places a great deal of importance on having good trade relations with Europe and we want our values to be respected. Protection of democracy may clash with the economic interests of European investors in China but it will be a temporary situation. If trading is to be fair, it is necessary to stand one’s ground and not to give in.</p>
<p class="contents">I regret the procrastination of the left-wing Members with regard to this issue during the Monday sitting, when they tried to block the vote on the joint resolution: as if they regretted that the support of Western Europe helped to bring down the communist regimes in Eastern Europe in 1968. </p>

Mr President, ladies and gentlemen, we have voted convincingly for this resolution, but Europe must do more. I have already written you a letter, Mr President, asking you to invite a delegation of Buddhist monks to Europe, accompanied perhaps by the high spiritual authority, the Dalai Lama, in respect of whom the Brussels authorities and the Belgian government have shamefully gone along with China’s diktat.</p>
<p class="contents">Talking of the Brussels authorities, I am astonished, Mr President, that there has not yet been a clear voice from your side condemning the wrongful and deliberate action of the Brussels authorities in respect of some MEPs. The battle for freedom is not just the battle of the Buddhist monks, it is the battle of those who protest democratically, for instance against the Islamicisation of Europe! The silence of the European Parliament is disgraceful, when MEPs like Vanhecke, Borghezio and others have demonstrated for the freedom of Europe! Shame! </p>

 Mr President, in its vote today, the European Parliament demands unfettered access for the United Nations envoy in the unfolding crisis in Burma, reversing that country’s decision to deny a visa to that envoy. There can be no moral equivalence between the visa ban on the Burmese generals and their ban on the legitimate representative of the international community. I welcome last night’s call by France to freeze assets in Burma. However, to freeze is not to disinvest and the targeted sanctions this Parliament calls for will not be realised unless assets are removed, and that includes French companies such as Total and Elf too. Finally, we not only call for protection for the protesters, but also express to them our solidarity. If this is a Saffron Revolution, we hope it will be peaceful, and in the name of human rights and democracy, we hope it will be successful. </p>

 Mr President, ladies and gentlemen, I did not take part in the vote on Myanmar, because I think that, despite our good intentions, the authorities of that country could not give a damn about what we vote.</p>
<p class="contents">I must point out, however, that the demonstrations were able to take place in Myanmar for several days without any major problems, whereas in our capital Brussels, a peaceful demonstration was brutally repressed no sooner than it had begun. Let us take a closer look at the violations of our rights, of our freedom to demonstrate in our Europe, before we start looking at other people’s houses! </p>

 Recent events in Burma provide unlimited proof, if such proof were needed, that democracy (with all that it implies, especially its underlying assumption, namely freedom) is what peoples aspire to. The idea that democracy is not compatible with certain peoples or geographical regions is a huge lie which even the most complacent <span class="italic">realpolitik</span>
 could barely countenance.</p>
<p class="contents">That said, it is clear that our statements alone do little to hasten the victory of this attempted democratic revolution. To ignore the fact that both China and Russia, on this as on other occasions, are pursuing a foreign policy which is completely incompatible with the values that we Europeans and our allies uphold, is a serious mistake.</p>
<p class="contents">The expansion of democracy is essential for a peaceful world and support for democratic movements, in concert with our allies, is our duty towards the values in which we believe.</p>
<p class="contents">Finally, I am convinced that on this, as on other occasions, it is important to understand the true geopolitical reality of the region, for fear of nurturing a perverse world order. </p>

I voted in favour of the own-initiative report by my Finnish colleague Lasse Lehtinen on the obligations of cross-border service providers.</p>
<p class="contents">It really is time to encourage the implementation of measures that will help to complete the internal market for services by having a uniform system of obligations for service providers, in order to further facilitate development of a seamless internal market. It is essential that not only consumers but also companies – and particularly SMEs, both as buyers and as sellers of cross-border services – should be able to benefit from greater legal certainty and simplicity, as well as a reduction in costs.</p>
<p class="contents">I support the idea, outlined in the report, that no distinction should be made between public and private service providers, which should both be equally subject to the field of application of the consumer-protection directives. </p>

 We voted against this report because it in fact attempts, using arguments such as ‘consumer protection’ and ‘legal uncertainty’, to give yet another boost to the already considerable deregulation of services, particularly public services, as the final resolution made abundantly clear.</p>
<p class="contents">If the objective were this much-needed consumer protection, there would have been more extensive discussion about the reasons for that low level of consumer protection and the meaning of that ‘legal uncertainty’, notably the deregulation of markets, privatisation of services, employment uncertainty and the living conditions of workers and consumers. It is these measures, approved in the name of the ‘single market’ and ‘competition rules’, which have diminished rights and made access to the most basic services more difficult.</p>
<p class="contents">Therefore, to conclude that it is necessary to pursue and to reinforce those policies, in the name of consumer protection, is not only unfair, but wrong, especially since the Commission has already announced its intention to reformulate thoroughly and harmonise the various provisions in force in relation to consumer rights.</p>
<p class="contents">Effective consumer protection means breaking with these policies and promoting the development of high-quality public services and dignifying work and the workforce. </p>

I voted in favour of the Lehtinen report on cross-border service providers and support moves which will increase consumer confidence in this area. The services sector makes up almost 70% of EU GDP and is continually growing. Nevertheless, consumer confidence remains low in cross-border service transactions and accordingly full advantage is not being taken of the internal market. My group considers that consumer confidence will be best served by the obligations of service providers being clearly set out across the EU so that consumers are adequately protected. </p>

 The Services Directive is unclear and cumbersome, and leaves power over how it is to be implemented in the hands of a Court of Justice which cannot be dismissed. Now we have a report which says explicitly: no new legislation in the services sector. That is good and will prevent any further damage. Besides there is the proposal to allow consumers to bring collective cross-border actions and a certain regulation of the liability of firms. This leads me to vote in favour, despite the call for new ‘initiatives’, i.e. laws at EU level, which are not necessary. After all, I can vote against them when they come before us... </p>

It is unacceptable for anyone in the EU to be discriminated against on grounds of his or her origin or religion.</p>
<p class="contents">Sentiments in some EU Member States indicate that discrimination is a frequent phenomenon. We are familiar with the example from the past of the discrimination against, and gradual assimilation of, the Slovak-speaking population in Hungary by establishments of a wide range of political hues – fascist, communist, socialist and right-wing – where only 37 000 now remain of the 500 000 Slovak-speaking citizens in the 1920s.</p>
<p class="contents">On the other hand, citizens who migrate to EU Member States should not create new ethnic settlements but should integrate completely and adopt the host country’s principles of freedom and democracy. Some of my British colleagues recently mentioned a situation where in Britain certain citizens publicly proclaimed the slogan ‘not British but Muslim’ on t-shirts at a peaceful meeting.</p>
<p class="contents">The transposition of an EU directive into the law of the Member States must comply with the highest possible standards, and it is right that the Member States are required to notify the existence of anti-discrimination provisions even though some citizens do not know about them and have little legal awareness in this regard. </p>

 Mr President, the European Parliament is embarking on a very dangerous course with this Buitenweg report and I voted against it, together with my Group. Because the combination of the right of so-called equality bodies to take people to court and reversal of the burden of proof in litigation and in other prohibited grounds for discrimination will undoubtedly in our view lead to a witch-hunt against people who hold a different and critical view. Because that is what this is all about. Europe wants a new inquisition against anyone who refuses to accept its dogmas and multicultural society. This has nothing to do with getting rid of discrimination against minority groups; it is all about legalising a carefully crafted political correctness.</p>
<p class="contents">If we want to attack real discrimination, we should address the situation of women in Europe’s Muslim community, or put pressure on the applicant country of Turkey over the way it blatantly discriminates against religious minorities, but of course that does not sit well with the European Parliament and its agenda. </p>

British Conservatives fully support the principle of equal treatment, irrespective of racial or ethnic origin. However, Conservatives have abstained on this report as elements of the report call for the shift of burden of proof from the accuser to the accused. It is a fundamental part of UK law that the principle of ‘innocent until proven guilty’ applies. We also feel that the EU should not become involved in any way in the judicial process in sovereign Member States. </p>

I welcome the adoption of this report, which makes a number of fair and balanced points and thoroughly covers the main problems in relation to the Directive’s application. It rightly states that very few of our fellow citizens are clearly aware of their rights and it calls for information to be disseminated more effectively.</p>
<p class="contents">In particular, I support the idea of granting sufficient resources to the bodies tasked with promoting equality. Theirs is a key role here, and it is indeed imperative that they remain independent.</p>
<p class="contents">The report records with concern the fact that certain Member States have failed to transpose the Directive, or at least to transpose it fully.</p>
<p class="contents">With regard to the most sensitive issue here, namely data collection, the report is careful to stipulate that it must be carried out in a manner respectful of personal privacy, and solely for the purpose of detecting forms of discrimination from which minorities may suffer.</p>
<p class="contents">When it comes to a principle of such fundamental importance as equality of treatment, Europe cannot be content simply to pay lip service, Europe cannot be content to enact a bare minimum of legislation, and Europe cannot be content to be a mere observer.

 We have already had occasion to emphasise, in connection with the much-vaunted ‘European Year of Equal Opportunity for All’ that, in terms of equal opportunities, the key question which emerges is that of guaranteed exercise of rights.</p>
<p class="contents">In other words, safeguarding and applying the principle of equal opportunity – especially as regards non-discrimination based on racial or ethnic origin, which is dealt with in this report – involves ensuring that there is universal access to and full exercise of basic rights, such as healthcare, food, education, employment, workers’ and trade union rights, fair pay, culture and entertainment, sport, citizenship and civic participation, amongst many others. However, the report only touches on this question which, in our view, is crucial.</p>
<p class="contents">It is clearly necessary for everyone to be fully aware of their rights and to be able to take action and obtain support when those rights are disregarded, especially in the light of guaranteed free and universal access to justice – a fundamental public service which underpins democracy – but the essential requirement is a thorough social transformation based on an attack against capitalism, the root cause of inequality. </p>

I support the Buitenweg report on equal treatment of persons irrespective of racial or ethnic origin. Discrimination on grounds of racial or ethnic origin or, indeed on grounds of disability, age, gender, faith or religion, social background or sexual orientation remain all too common throughout the EU. Individual Member States and the EU as a whole must take action to eliminate discrimination in all its forms – from targeting individual incidents on the streets, to abolishing the UK’s archaic Act of Settlement. </p>

I endorse the report by Mrs Buitenweg on equal treatment between persons irrespective of racial or ethnic origin.</p>
<p class="contents">Racism conflicts with all the European Union’s principles, and it is shocking to discover that the number of recorded racist attacks in the European Union has risen dramatically. That is why I believe we should attach far more importance to providing information about the anti-discrimination laws and means of asserting one’s rights. Furthermore, I support the rapporteur’s call for the Commission not only to look into the correct legal transposition of the Directive, but also to consider the obstacles on the ground. </p>

 Sometimes a parliamentarian finds himself between a rock and a hard place in the choices he has to make. The vote on this report was a typical example of that. On the one hand, we have a report which deals with the introduction of legislation large parts of which I find highly dubious; on the other hand, amendments from the ITS Group which in most cases did not remedy the weaknesses of the report but proposed the introduction of new, even worse, arguments. It is hardly possible to vote for ITS contributions. I therefore decided to abstain in the vote.</p>
<p class="contents">There is no doubt that discrimination is still a widespread problem in Europe and one which is hard to eradicate. I do not deny that there may be good grounds for discussing how it might be tackled jointly at intergovernmental level. In this particular case, however, we are dealing with legislation which is very far-reaching and based on a principle of law which is fairly alien to our concepts. Positive action is in itself a dubious method, but the recording of a person’s race – a condition for ensuring that such action can work – is unacceptable, both from a moral point of view and from that of safeguarding personal integrity. Equally there are sound reasons for reservations over the reversal of the burden of proof. I am convinced that our system of justice, which is based on the principle that a person is innocent until proved guilty, must be defended, however laudable the initial intention may have been. </p>

I am voting in favour of the report by Mrs Buitenweg on the implementation of the principle of equal treatment between persons irrespective of racial or ethnic origin.</p>
<p class="contents">Mrs Buitenweg has prepared an excellent report. Despite the progress in transposing anti-discrimination directives, there has still been no reduction in the number of victims of racial or ethnic discrimination.</p>
<p class="contents">Making it easier to pursue one’s rights through the courts and assistance with the legal process are very important issues, to which the rapporteur referred.</p>
<p class="contents">I also believe that it is very important to make information on the rights of EU citizens widely available, as rights are of little use if people do not know about them or do not know how they can benefit from them. In order to deal with this situation at work, employers in Poland have been obliged to inform their employees about anti-discrimination legislation.</p>
<p class="contents">We must ensure that, in the context of the European Year of Equal Opportunities, both European Union institutions and Member States should make every effort to ensure that every person in Europe knows about their rights. </p>

 Mr President, I supported the Kauppi report on equality between women and men in the EU. Europe has led the way to a position where enormous strides have been made in equality, all the way across the Union.</p>
<p class="contents">One particular area of progress has been in public protection services, in particular in the fire services. Yet in my own constituency, despite massive protests by the Fire Brigades Union and the public, these advances are under threat as the Liberal-controlled County Council is threatening to cut GBP 700 000 from the budget, ending 24-hour fire cover in the last two remaining fire stations in Camborne and Falmouth, while they pay themselves an extra GBP 1 million a year in allowances. </p>

 I am pleased that four of the five proposals which I presented on behalf of our Group for voting in the plenary, and which formed part of my opinion adopted by the Committee on Agriculture, have been approved.</p>
<p class="contents">I draw attention to the high levels of poverty and isolation affecting women in some rural areas, stressing the need for effective measures to guarantee equal opportunities for women, which must be a central objective in all instruments of the common agricultural policy (CAP) and other relevant Community policies.</p>
<p class="contents">It was also important to view improving the quality of life of women living in rural areas as vital, ensuring that they have easier access to education and vocational training, lifelong learning, new media infrastructures, efficient and suitable local public health services, and infrastructure and facilities for children and families, particularly local crèches, nurseries, schools, cultural centres and markets.</p>

Junilistan considers that equality between women and men is a fundamental democratic issue which must be prioritised in all countries throughout the world.</p>
<p class="contents">The report contains many proposals on how equality should be achieved, some of them focusing on employment policy measures, the participation of women in political life and training plans of various kinds. However, it emerges clearly that, as usual, it is a question of increasing the financial resources of the Union and its power and of launching costly campaigns under Union auspices. The EU institutions are not the right bodies for matters of this kind. Harmonisation often results in a step backwards for those countries which have advanced furthest, since the starting basis varies greatly from one country to another.</p>
<p class="contents">Equality between men and women must be a goal for all the Member States to strive for, but the matter must be dealt with at national level. We have chosen to vote against this report, since the intention is to extend the powers of the EU at the expense of the sovereign states within the European Union. </p>

Mr President, I am voting in favour of the report by Mrs Kauppi on equality between women and men in the European Union.</p>
<p class="contents">In her report Mrs Kauppi calls on Member States to fight against inequality in the employment of women and men.</p>
<p class="contents">Inequality is most obvious in the area of employment. The average difference in salaries between women and men in the EU is 15%, and in some countries the difference is as high as 30%. As many as 32% of women have part-time jobs, compared with 7% of men.</p>
<p class="contents">Attention should be given to the situation of female immigrants and women from ethnic minorities, older women and single mothers, who are marginalised and discriminated against in many areas of life.</p>
<p class="contents">We should fight against gender stereotyping, which is seen at work, in education and in the media. It would also be good to prepare information campaigns, so that women could themselves deal with situations that insult their dignity. </p>

I voted in favour of Mrs Kauppi’s report because it formally calls on the European Commission to develop gender analysis and mainstreaming with regard to the impact of pension reforms on women’s lives in the European Union, with the aim of individualising pension rights, and social security and tax systems.</p>
<p class="contents">Having served in 1997 as rapporteur on the situation of assisting spouses of the self-employed, in small businesses and farming, I would point out that 10 years down the line we are still awaiting proposals from the Commission for strengthening the 1986 Directive and creating a European framework to give a status to assisting spouses – those tens of millions of workers who are statistically invisible, and many of whom possess no social insurance cover for illness, disability or old age, especially in the event of divorce.</p>

<p>This answer, which was drafted by the Presidency and is binding on neither the Council nor the Member States, was not given orally during Questions to the Council at the September II part-session of the European Parliament in Strasbourg.</p>
<p>Gender equality is indeed one of the core values and objectives of the European Union. Despite the progress already achieved there is still a long way to go, particularly in terms of gender mainstreaming, in other words promoting equality between men and women in all spheres. In line with the commitments repeatedly given by the Member States in this field, the Portuguese Presidency is currently trying to ensure that gender equality issues are included in all the relevant fora, including in the work of the Council.</p>
<p>The Council regularly examines the question of gender mainstreaming when it reviews the implementation of the Beijing Platform for Action. Successive presidencies have already devised indicators for the principal areas of concern defined in the Beijing Platform. On this matter, the Portuguese Presidency is in the process of devising a set of indicators in relation to ‘women and poverty’, in addition to a package of Council conclusions, to be submitted for Council approval in December. A conference will be held in Porto from 8-9 October on ‘Trafficking in human beings and gender’.</p>
<p>The programme of the Portuguese Presidency also includes various other initiatives to promote gender mainstreaming, as already announced by the Minister, Pedro Silva Pereira, to the European Parliament when he addressed the Committee on Women’s Rights and Gender Equality on 16 June 2007.</p>
<p>The High-Level Group on Gender Mainstreaming met in Lisbon on 11 September 2007. The Group discussed the planned ‘women and poverty’ indicators, equality between men and women in the Lisbon Strategy, the preparations for the forthcoming 52<span class="sup">nd</span>
 session of the UN Committee on the Status of Women, as well as a series of other important matters. On 5 October 2007 the Presidency will host an informal meeting of ministers responsible for equality between men and women.</p>
<p>Lastly, the Presidency is pleased to point out that 2007 is the European Year of Equal Opportunities for All, an initiative based on a joint decision of the European Parliament and the Council. Various events have already been held, with the Closing Conference scheduled for 19 November in Lisbon. In December the Presidency intends to submit a draft resolution to the Council reflecting the results achieved during the course of the year.</p>
<p>To conclude, over and above the progress already made in Europe in recent decades on gender equality, the Presidency is determined to take the promotion of this objective a step further, particularly through gender mainstreaming.</p>

<p>The Council cannot take a position on the matter raised by Mrs Harkin. Under Article 48 of the EU Treaty, the Intergovernmental Conference (IGC) is a conference of representatives of the governments of the Member States. Although it is convened by the President of the Council, the Council does not participate in the conference nor is it associated with it.</p>
<p>In accordance with the practice followed by previous IGCs, the meetings of the Conference are not open to the public. However, I would draw Mrs Harkin’s attention to the fact that all the Conference documents are made available to the general public and are accessible on the Council website, thus enabling individual citizens and civil society to follow the matters debated by the Conference.</p>
<p>I would also like to point out that the European Parliament is closely and actively associated with the work of the Intergovernmental Conference, which was tasked with drafting the Reform Treaty, sending three representatives.</p>

<p>On 2 September, by inaugurating a monument funded by local businessmen commemorating both those who gave their lives to combat fascism and the members of the Ukrainian fascist organisation which collaborated with the Nazi occupation forces, the local authorities of Krychovski, Western Ukraine, have bracketed together the persecutors and victims of the Second World War. The monument's sole plaque bears the names of 44 inhabitants of the region who died while fighting the Nazis in the ranks of the Red Army and, just opposite, the names of 16 local fascists who collaborated with the Nazis.</p>
<p>What does the Council think of the increasing efforts being made throughout Europe - and the governments of the Baltic States which are members of the European Union have led the way in this matter - to pass over in silence the people's triumph over fascism, rewrite history, and legitimise the Nazis and their collaborators, as well as the crimes against humanity which they perpetrated?</p>

<p>The International Organisation for Standardisation (ISO) is a non-governmental organisation which currently comprises standardisation bodies from 157 countries.</p>
<p>The European Union is not and cannot become a member of the ISO, although all the Member States participate in various ways in the activities of that organisation (as member bodies or as correspondent members) .</p>
<p>Given that there are no delegations from the EU Member States, it would be very difficult to ask national standardisation bodies to coordinate their positions.</p>
<p>As regards making an impact assessment prior to the submission of a new legislative proposal, the Commission assesses the consequences of any standardisation policy, especially if it is likely to hinder free competition.</p>
<p>It is not for the Council to impose penalties for anti-competitive conduct. The powers to do this were conferred on the Commission under Article 85(2) of the EC Treaty.</p>

<p>According to complaints by academics and reports from reliable press sources, the German police have arrested four university sociology researchers and are holding them under unacceptable conditions. They have been accused on grounds as flimsy as using terms used by terrorist organisations in their academic writing, such as 'inequality' and 'gentrification', conspiratorial circumstances such as 'not using mobile phones during meetings with activists' and even of being 'intellectually in a position to compile sophisticated texts'.</p>
<p>Is the Council aware of these facts? Does the Council think that such actions are encouraged by the false dichotomy between human rights and security? Does it believe that anti-terrorist legislation at EU and Member State level is encouraging arbitrary behaviour on the part of the law enforcement authorities, creating a climate of fear about the terrorist threat, and breaching fundamental human rights?</p>

<p>Following a humiliating procedure involving personal interviews and finger-printing, the French Embassy in Minsk has refused to grant a visa to Mr Igor Karpenko, Member of Parliament and Second Secretary of the Belarusian Communist Party, to enable him to attend the festival held by the newspaper Avante in Portugal. Several months ago, the Czech authorities refused to grant a visa to Mrs Tatiana Golubeva, Member of Parliament and First Secretary of the Bielarusian Communist Party, to enable her to travel to Prague to attend a meeting of communist parties. In both cases, the refusal to grant the visa was decided only hours before the scheduled departure of the persons concerned and despite the fact that they held diplomatic passports.</p>
<p>Does the Council condemn the approach adopted by the competent authorities in refusing to accept diplomatic passports from a country with which the European Union and its Member States maintain diplomatic relations, the subjecting of members of parliament to humiliating procedures such as finger-printing and the granting of visas on the basis of arbitrary political criteria?</p>

<p>This answer, which was drafted by the Presidency and is binding on neither the Council nor the Member States, was not given orally during Questions to the Council at the September II part-session of the European Parliament in Strasbourg.</p>
<p>The Council would like to inform the honourable Member that Mr Igor Karpenko is covered by the European visa restrictions approved in Common Position 2006/362/CFSP of 18 May 2006 amending Common Position 2006/276/CFSP concerning restrictive measures against certain officials of Belarus, implemented by Council Decision 2006/718/CFSP of 23 October 2006. Pursuant to those legal provisions, ‘Member States shall take the necessary measures to prevent the entry into, or transit through, their territories of persons who are responsible for the violations of international electoral standards in the presidential elections in Belarus on 19 March 2006 and the crackdown on civil society and democratic opposition’.</p>
<p>Attendance at the Avante Festival is not covered by any of the situations envisaged in Article 1(2), (3), (4) and (6) of Common Position 2006/276/CFSP which permit derogation from the admission restriction. In fact the person concerned is not a Portuguese national, none of the obligations of international law referred to in Article 1(3) and (4) come into play, there is no urgent humanitarian need justifying travel and finally the Avante Festival is not an intergovernmental meeting where a political dialogue is to be conducted that directly promotes democracy, human rights and the rule of law in Belarus.</p>
<p>As a matter of general policy, the decision whether or not to issue visas to nationals of third countries who need to be in possession of a visa when crossing the external borders of a Member State of the European Union is a matter for the Member State in question. As a general rule, holders of diplomatic or official-duty passports are not exempt from visa requirements when the country of which they are a national is included in the common list in Annex I of Regulation (EC) 539/2001 of 15 March 2001. That same regulation allows Member States to provide for visa exemptions for holders of diplomatic or official-duty passports, but this did not occur between the States in question. A Belarus diplomatic passport is accepted as a travel document but only allows entry into the territory of the Member States if accompanied by a visa.</p>
<p>Subjection of visa applicants to a personal interview is one of the normal requirements laid down in the Common Consular Instructions (2005/C 326/01) and cannot be regarded as humiliating or arbitrary treatment. As for fingerprinting, this will also become a requirement with the introduction of the Visa Information System (VIS), scheduled for 2009. In this area, there is no blanket exemption for holders of diplomatic passports.</p>

<p>This agreement introduces, even if in limited fashion, specific safeguard measures for Chinese exports, and does not concern imports into the EU from other third countries.</p>
<p>An increasing number of organisations in the sector have issued warnings regarding the need for measures to limit the exponential growth of textile and clothing imports into the EU - thus avoiding a repetition of the events of 2005 - such as extending the restrictions currently in force and applying them to new categories, in line with the agreements concluded with China and the US.</p>

<p>The Commission’s framework programmes for research and technology development (RTD) have for many years supported research into renewable bio-resources. The current (7<span class="sup">th</span>
) Framework Programme (FP7), under theme 5 "Energy", puts a particular emphasis on biomass-related research, with biofuel development being a key priority. The main focus is on (1) cost-competitive 1<span class="sup">st</span>
 generation biofuels produced from food crops, (2) 2<span class="sup">nd</span>
 generation biofuels produced from lignocellulosic or "woody" biomass, and (3) integrated production of energy and products from biomass in bio-refineries. Under theme 2 "Food, Agriculture and Fisheries, and Biotechnology", collaborative research on renewable resources and their use is supported in three areas 1) Improved biomass and plant renewables, 2) Bioprocesses, and 3) Environmental biotechnologies, Use of waste and by-products. The results from EU funded biomass research in previous framework programmes over the past decade can be found at http://www.biomatnet.org/home.html" </p>
<p>Any research organisation, legally established in any country, may participate in FP7, provided that the minimum conditions as laid down in the Rules for Participation have been met. Actual research funding through FP7 can only be sought by putting together a pan-transnational consortium of partners who then submit a project proposal in response to a specific topic in a dedicated annual call for proposals. Research centres can also help shape EU RTD priorities by contributing to the research agendas of the relevant technology platforms.</p>
<p>The European Commission supports networking of research in the field of bioenergy renewable resources and bioenergy through the use of different instruments. For example, the Network of Excellence “Overcoming barriers to bioenergy” aims at the sharing of research infrastructures and research personnel in one or more of the most relevant areas of bioenergy by the creation of a new and integrated structure (a “virtual” research institute). Another example is the Coordination Action “NETBIOCOF” that promotes European cooperation between research organisations in the field of biomass co-firing in new and existing power plants. The Specific Support Action "EPOBIO", supported in the 6<span class="sup">th</span>
 Framework Programme, aims to apply genomics knowledge to improve the economic potential of plant-derived raw materials for energy or chemical use.</p>
<p>The ERA-NET<a href="#defann_10_1" name="refann_10_1"><sup>(1)</sup></a>
 scheme provides support for the coordination of national and regional research programmes in the European Research Area. In this respect, the individual ERA-NETS for Industrial Biotechnology, for Bioenergy and for Plants are extremely relevant.</p>
<p>European Technology Platforms also foster networking of research by bringing together all interested stakeholders in a certain field. There are four Platforms in particular which have an important bearing on the area of renewable bio-resources: (1) Sustainable Chemistry, (2) Plants for the Future, (3) Biofuels and (4) Forest-Based Sector. These platforms have developed strategic research agendas, which provide key input to research priorities in FP7.</p>
<p>In addition, the FP7 Capacities Work Programme includes integrating activities to support the networking of existing research infrastructures. One of the priority topics under this programme aims at the development of the next generation of bio-fuels.</p>
<p>Besides the Framework Programme, the Commission has also set up a Member States' network for the coordination, the promotion and the implementation of the Knowledge Based Bio-Economy in the Member States, called the KBBE-NET.</p>
<p>As already mentioned there are a number of initiatives currently being financed by the 6<span class="sup">th</span>
 and 7<span class="sup">th</span>
 Framework Programmes for RTD aiming at networking and coordinating research activities in the area of renewable resources. The need for financing further activities or enhancing existing ones will be assessed in the light of the outcome of ongoing progress and inputs received in the development of future FP7 Work Programmes.</p>

<p>The Commission is fully conscious of the need to act in order to facilitate circulation of researchers in Europe and to promote their career development. It is the reason why a strategy - taking into account the repartition of competence with the Member States- has been defined in the recent years concerning these two aspects, particularly through two Communications endorsed by the Council.</p>
<p>This strategy has resulted in a number of important initiatives of a legislative, financial or more concrete nature.</p>
<p>Concerning the promotion of the geographical, intersectoral or interdisciplinary mobility, a lot has already been achieved, with for instance the strong increase in the budget under 7<span class="sup">th</span>
 Framework Programme (FP7) concerning human resources and especially through the Marie Curie grants; the European Mobility Portal and European Network of Mobility Centres; the ERA<a href="#defann_11_1" name="refann_11_1"><sup>(1)</sup></a>
-Link pilot initiative to network European researchers in the US; the EU 'scientific visa' directive and recommendations.</p>
<p>Other initiatives relate more to the promotion of the researchers' career. Thus a Recommendation on the European Charter for Researcher and a Code of Conduct for their recruitment was adopted and its adoption promoted via a number of information and awareness actions both at national and European level. A study on the remuneration of researchers was also launched, showing the progress still to ameliorate the attractiveness of the profession of researcher.</p>
<p>The interest of the Commission for the question of researchers is also attested by the recent consultation launched through the ERA Green Paper. Stakeholders are asked whether there is a need for a more effective European framework to improve mobility conditions for researchers and portability of supplementary pensions rights and also to ensure improved working conditions to them. The answers to this consultation will be carefully studied together with the results of another questionnaire on new forms of mobility, more focused on whether there is a need to adapt rules for coordination of social security schemes.</p>
<p>The Commission is currently doing this analysis work and it is thus too early to make proposals. However, it is already apparent that the majority of stakeholders are in favour of more stringent and concrete measures. In the forthcoming months, therefore, the Commission may propose specific measures aimed at removing remaining obstacles to the movement of researchers.</p>
<p>The Commission does not intend to propose harmonisation of the legal status as well as level of remuneration of researchers throughout Europe, which are fields under national competence. Nevertheless, in light of the set of principles stated in the Charter &amp; Code, the Commission may propose initiatives aimed among others at improving researchers' working conditions in order to make a career in research attractive.</p>

<p>Transit traffic through the Brenner pass has grown by more than 50% since 1998. Almost 6000 lorries per day crossed the Alps through this pass in the first half of 2007. Given that the Alps are a particularly ecologically sensitive area, the decision was taken some time ago to provide some relief for the affected area and its inhabitants by building the Brenner base tunnel (BBT). The Brenner/BBT has been listed as the first project in TEN-T from the outset.</p>
<p>The BBT project is expected to cost between EUR 4.5 and 8 billion, a sum which is to be shared between the Member States concerned and the EU. Italy and Austria submitted the requisite documents for the call for Community financial assistance in the field of transport and energy scheduled for the autumn in July 2007.</p>
<p>Can the Commission confirm whether the 30% rule adopted by Parliament in 2007 will be applied when Community financial assistance is granted? What action will the Commission take to remedy the communication deficit with the population on the benefits of the BBT? How will the Commission safeguard funding for the BBT after 2012?</p>

<p>The Berlin-Verona/Milan-Bologna-Naples-Messina-Palermo rail axis (priority axis No 1) is one of 30 priority projects in the trans-European transport network (TEN-T). The Brenner base tunnel project, to which the Honourable Member referred, is the central link on this priority axis. On 10 July 2007 a memorandum of understanding was signed by Werner Faymann and Antonio Di Pietro, the Ministers for Transport of Austria and Italy respectively, in the presence of their German counterpart, Wolfgang Tiefensee, who gave an assurance that Germany would do everything necessary to ensure interoperability and provide the required access capacity on the north side of the tunnel when it came into service.</p>
<p>The signing of the memorandum of understanding enabled the two Member States to submit a single, coordinated Community financing proposal for the Brenner base tunnel in July 2007, in accordance with the Community criteria for cross-border projects. The Commission is currently assessing all the proposals received from the 27 Member States in response to the call for proposals for Community financial support for work in connection with priority projects on the TEN-T network. On the basis of that assessment it will decide, in late autumn 2007, how to allocate the TEN-T budget for the period 2007-2013.</p>
<p>At this stage the Commission cannot indicate whether a Community grant will be awarded to this priority project.</p>
<p>Nor can it give any guarantees with regard to potential financing for the Brenner base tunnel after 2013. It is unable to give any undertaking in relation to future European Union budgets.</p>
<p>The Commission is closely following progress with the Berlin-Palermo project in general and the Brenner base tunnel in particular. In July 2005 it appointed a European coordinator for this axis, Karel Van Miert, who submitted his second activity report on 19 July 2007. The report was forwarded to the Chair of the TRAN<a href="#defann_13_1" name="refann_13_1"><sup>(1)</sup></a>
 Committee on 10 September 2007. Mr Van Miert is deeply committed to the task of coordinating this priority project.</p>

<p>The Commission is fully aware of the importance of ensuring mobility toward island regions and it regards adequate transport as a condition for social and economic cohesion. These concerns are shared by the island Member States.</p>
<p>Air transport is clearly the most rapid way of ensuring this mobility. The single European aviation market has been successfully established, thus facilitating a considerable increase in the number of routes and operators and greatly benefiting consumers.</p>
<p>Member States may, under certain conditions, grant start-up aid to encourage the establishment of new routes. The Commission must be notified of such aid under Article 88 of the EC Treaty. It assesses the aid in the light of Articles 86 and 87 of the Treaty and the Community guidelines on financing of airports and start-up aid to airlines departing from regional airports.<a href="#defann_14_1" name="refann_14_1"><sup>(1)</sup></a>
</p>
<p>There is currently provision in the European legislation for public-service obligations (PSOs) to be imposed in respect of air transport if the market is not meeting the actual needs of states or regions.</p>
<p>PSOs may be subject to certain conditions with regard to exclusive rights for a three-year period, renewable via a tendering procedure.</p>
<p>In order to make PSOs attractive to more applicants, the Commission has proposed to extend that period to four years.</p>
<p>Finally, support projects of a social nature, aimed at reducing the price of air travel for island residents, are in principle compatible with the common market provided that they do not lead to unjustified discrimination between those who benefit from them or between airlines.</p>

These regions depend exclusively on air transport, both for the mobility of OR residents to and from the rest of Europe and for the mobility to and from the ORs of tourists and agents of socio-economic development. That is why, in the context of addressing climate change, the Commission is inviting its partners to discuss ‘what measures are needed to prevent the aim of reducing emissions from adversely affecting the accessibility, economy and citizens of the ORs’.</p>
<p>The communication is addressed to Parliament, the Council, the European Economic and Social Committee and the Committee of the Regions. It will be discussed in exchanges with all four institutions, starting with Parliament. A partnership approach will also be pursued in the ongoing and future implementation of the strategy for ORs.</p>
<p>The Commission will ensure that suitable specific measures are adopted in the various relevant fields over the period 2007-2013, deploying the resources necessary to that end, and will prepare a strategy for the future when the consultation phase has been completed.</p>

<p>In 2005 the European Neighbourhood Programme Initiative (ENPI) was adopted. So far, it seems that there has been a slow uptake in the specific Member States. There is therefore concern about the progress of the programme.</p>
<p>In order to strengthen the European neighbourhood policy I understand that the Commission will evaluate yearly – the first time being at the end of 2007 – the European Neighbourhood Policy Initiative on cross-border cooperation. This will most likely include information on the local and regional uptake per country concerned, the joint operational programmes and the related decentralised capacity-building.</p>
<p>Together with the evaluation, what measures will the Commission propose to increase the uptake of the cross-border initiatives at local and regional level?</p>

<p>Since the European Neighbourhood and Partnership Instrument (ENPI) was adopted later than expected and entered into force only on 29 November 2006 it is too early to have either evidence of possible poor uptake of cross-border initiatives or to express concerns in this regard. On the contrary, the Commission expects this new financing instrument to enable better and more flexible co-operation on various aspects of the European Neighbourhood Policy (ENP), especially with regard to cross-border cooperation (CBC) issues.</p>
<p>Currently the CBC programmes are being jointly elaborated by the participating countries. The Commission expects that the majority of programmes will be submitted in 2007, which should allow them to be adopted at the turn of 2007. This is still well within the provisions of Art 9 (6) of ENPI stipulating that programmes shall be submitted “one year after the adoption of the CBC Strategy Paper (e.g. by March 2008)”. The relatively long time needed to prepare the programmes can be explained by the novelty of the approach: it is the first time that Member States and Partner Countries go through the exercise of defining together (and in consultation with local partners) their priorities and identifying the measures to be funded over the next seven years.</p>
<p>In any event, under point 48 of the “Interinstitutional Agreement” on budgetary discipline and sound financial management, the two arms of the budgetary authority have undertaken to authorise the transfer to subsequent years, of allocations not used in 2007. This also applies to the European Regional Development Fund (ERDF) contribution to the ENPI.</p>
<p>The Commission is closely monitoring the preparation and implementation of the cross-border cooperation programmes, also taking into account elements such as those mentioned by the Honourable Member (local/regional uptake of the programmes). On that basis the Commission might revise and adapt its CBC Strategy during its mid-term review.</p>

<p>Appropriate laws have been adopted in EU countries guaranteeing equal opportunities for disabled people. In practice, however, the needs of disabled people are often discriminated against, particularly because of inadequate adaptation of accommodation and of the infrastructure of the public environment. In many EU Member States, people with restricted movement, sight or hearing or with other disabilities cannot reach certain institutions, find work or use sources of information or cultural or other services accessible to other members of society because the environment has not been adapted to their needs.</p>
<p>Discussions are currently under way about preparing a specific directive that would require all Member States to guarantee that the environment is satisfactorily adapted to disabled persons’ needs.

<p>In a recent judgment, the Turkish Supreme Court ruled that the Ecumenical Patriarch had to be elected in accordance with a 1923 Decree, which states that only Turkish citizens who perform their duties within Turkey have the right to vote and to stand for election. In this way the Turkish State, disregarding the Community acquis and in particular the European Convention on Human Rights and the case-law of the European Court of Human Rights, is intervening in the internal organisation of a religious community, imposing severe restrictions on the right of non-Turkish subjects to exercise their right to religious freedom through their participation in the activities of the religious communities to which they belong. This problem has been repeatedly raised in the Commission’s progress reports on Turkey.</p>

<p>The methods for calculating the estimated value of public contracts are set out in Article 9 of Directive 2004/18/EC. According to this provision, the calculation of the estimated value of a public contract shall be based on the total amount payable, net of value added tax (VAT), as estimated by the contracting authority. This estimate must be valid at the moment at which the contract notice is sent or, in cases where such notice is not required, at the moment at which the contracting authority commences the contract awarding procedure.</p>
<p>Therefore, if it turns out at the moment of awarding the contract that only tenders with a value above the threshold have been submitted, this does not necessarily call into question the choice of the award procedure. In particular, it is not required to cancel the procedure and organise a new EU-wide procedure, if the contracting authority can demonstrate that at the time of estimating the value, it acted bona fide and in accordance with the rules set out above.</p>
<p>In any event, contracting authorities have to be aware of the fact that contracts below the thresholds for application of the EU Directives on the award of public contracts have nevertheless to be awarded in accordance with the general rules and principles of Community law. These require, in particular, a sufficient degree of advertising for the award of contracts that might be relevant to the Internal Market. The Commission has published an Interpretative Communication<a href="#defann_20_2" name="refann_20_2"><sup>(2)</sup></a>
 where it explains its views on the practical implication of these Community law principles.</p>
<p>If the Honourable Member wishes to have an opinion on a specific case, the Commission is of course willing to examine any facts that would be submitted to it in order to evaluate whether the above-mentioned conditions of legality of the tender have been complied with.</p>

<p>In response to the second stage consultation, the ETUC<a href="#defann_21_5" name="refann_21_5"><sup>(5)</sup></a>
, BUSINESSEUROPE<a href="#defann_21_6" name="refann_21_6"><sup>(6)</sup></a>
, UEAPME<a href="#defann_21_7" name="refann_21_7"><sup>(7)</sup></a>
 and CEEP<a href="#defann_21_8" name="refann_21_8"><sup>(8)</sup></a>
 have decided to set up a joint working group, within the context of the European social dialogue, to evaluate the framework agreement on parental leave. They have also indicated that the European social partners intend to use this opportunity to evaluate parental leave arrangements in connection with other arrangements supporting parents and work-life balance to assess if actions need to be taken. They will report on progress in March 2008. The aforementioned organisations, as well as other European social partners, have also submitted individual responses to the second stage consultation.</p>
<p>The Commission is examining the social partners' responses at present. It is therefore too early to say if the Commission will submit a legislative proposal on paternity leave (i.e. a short period of leave for fathers around the time of the birth or adoption of a child).</p>
<p>Should the Commission decide to submit a legislative proposal in this area, the Member States and Parliament will have an opportunity to discuss and amend it, as any legislative proposal on paternity leave would be adopted in accordance with the procedure laid down in Article 251 of the EC Treaty.</p>
<p>Issues relating to leave, including paternity leave, fall within the scope of Article 137(1)(a) of the Treaty i.e. working conditions. Community action to support and complement the activities of the Member States in this area is therefore possible.</p>

<p>Based on an inspection in March 2007 on the implementation of the relevant EU animal and public health requirements, the Commission assessment is that the current situation in Brazil does not warrant any immediate change to the import rules on beef currently in place.</p>
<p>However, following this inspection the Commission has continued to put pressure on the Brazilian authorities in order for them to further improve their veterinary control measures.</p>
<p>A further inspection in Brazil is foreseen before the end of 2007 and the Commission is ready to take further action, as appropriate.</p>
<p>The EU cannot require a third country to implement some of the veterinary measures applied within the EU like those on traceability, as this would clearly be against the principles and rules of the SPS/WTO<a href="#defann_23_1" name="refann_23_1"><sup>(1)</sup></a>
 agreement.</p>
<p>Nevertheless, EU requirements on imports of beef are science-based, proportionate and non-discriminatory, sometimes stricter than the OIE<a href="#defann_23_2" name="refann_23_2"><sup>(2)</sup></a>
 standards and adequate to protect the health of EU consumers. The Commission, together with the Member States, strives to ensure that imported products comply with these import conditions.</p>
<p>The Commission is aware of a visit carried out in Brazil by the Irish Farmer's Association (IFA), on the basis of which a report has been prepared. The IFA report does not provide accurate information on the EU requirements applied to the import of beef from Brazil.</p>

<p>The reasons why authorising a Genetically Modified (GM) crop takes on average longer in the EU than in Third Countries are complex. They deserve a specific analysis. The Commission would mention different factors:</p>
<p>One is that the current system for the authorization of GM food and feed is applicable only since April 2004 and, just like any new mechanism, needed some time to optimize its functioning. This is also true for the biotech companies which had to familiarize with new regulatory requirements.</p>
<p>Second, in order to provide an answer to the concerns of the EU citizens on the safety of GM crops, the new regulatory framework has put in place an evaluation system which is far more demanding than any other in the world. This obliges companies to prepare specific dossiers and to reply to a series of scientific questions eventually posed by the European Food Safety Authority (EFSA) during the risk assessment procedure.</p>
<p>A third element is the lack of support on the conclusions of the scientific evaluation and hence the Commission proposals for the approval of Genetically Modified Organisms (GMOs) by Member States. The difficulty to get the support of a qualified majority of Member States obliges the Commission to follow the path of the comitology procedure in its entirety, i.e. to involve the Council.</p>
<p>Against this situation, the position of the Commission has always been clear. It is determined to fully implement the legislative framework avoiding any possible deadlock in the authorisation procedure without compromising on the principle of a very strict risk assessment.</p>
<p>Along this line, and as a consequence of the experience gained in these three years, relevant improvements have already been registered.</p>
<p>For example, the time taken by EFSA to carry out its completeness check on any new dossier has been reduced and the Authority has recently taken the commitment to finalise this section of the risk assessment within six weeks from the submission of the application.</p>
<p>A similar positive trend occurred in the validation of the detection methods, another crucial part of the process.</p>
<p>Furthermore the Commission has taken different initiatives to gain more support from Member States. Following the College debate on GMOs of April 2006, a specific action plan has been defined with the objective of improving the scientific consistency and transparency of the decisions on GMOs. For instance the GMO Panel of EFSA is now systematically providing explanations on how the comments raised by Member States have been taken into account in its opinions. Recent votes have shown an improvement in the support of Member States to authorisation proposals.</p>

<p>The Commission can confirm that an application for EU Solidarity Fund (EUSF) assistance has been received from the United Kingdom (UK) government on 20 August 2007. It has been announced to the Commission that more detailed information, in particular updated damage estimates, would be presented towards the end of September 2007.</p>
<p>If the UK application is assessed to be meeting the criteria for mobilising the Solidarity Fund, the Commission will propose an amount of aid to the budgetary authority who has to approve the necessary appropriations by way of an amending budget procedure.</p>
<p>The amount of aid is calculated in a standard way based on total direct damage and taking into consideration the damage threshold for mobilising the Fund applicable to the country in question. For the UK the threshold in 2007 is € 3.267 billion: A lower rate of aid of 2.5% is granted for the part of the damage below the threshold plus a higher rate of aid of 6% for the part of the damage exceeding the threshold. Any final amount will depend on the detailed analysis of the file and therefore a precise figure cannot be given at this stage.</p>
<p>At this stage it is not possible to predict how long the different steps of the procedure will take. It should be noted that EUSF aid may only be used for specific types of emergency operations relating to the damage caused by the floods (including the securing of preventive infrastructures). Financing preventive measures is not possible under the EUSF; however, the cohesion policy operational programmes of the regions concerned could include such measures.</p>

<p>The Commission would first like to assure the Honourable Member that it is perfectly aware of the major importance of health services and notably pharmacy services for European citizens.</p>
<p>The Commission would however wish to stress that its infringement policy in this field is not calling for a "liberalisation" of the pharmacy service sector.</p>
<p>The objective of the infringement procedures is to ensure the compatibility of the national legislations on establishment of pharmacies with the fundamental freedoms enshrined in the Treaty. The Commission has received and is still receiving a number of complaints from European citizens who claim that the conditions of establishment of pharmacists in some Member States are discriminatory, not transparent or unnecessarily restrictive and therefore flout their fundamental freedoms. It is the Commission's duty, as guardian of the EC Treaty, to ensure, if necessary by pursuing infringement procedures that the fundamental freedoms already conferred to the citizens are respected, over and above the existence of an Act of secondary law on the subject.</p>
<p>This does not imply that the Commission considers that this front-line health service cannot be subject to proportionate health related measures to ensure accessibility and more generally the highest level of pharmacy service provision to all citizens in the broadest sense of that term.</p>
<p>This position also does not imply that other Articles of the Treaty are in any way amended or that there is any conflict with the prerogatives of other institutions. As regards precisely Article 152 of the EC Treaty quoted by the Honourable Member, it is worth mentioning that the Court of Justice has had the opportunity to recall in a recent ruling of 16 May 2006<a href="#defann_27_1" name="refann_27_1"><sup>(1)</sup></a>
 that if, according to Article 152 (5), Community action in the field of public health must fully respect the responsibilities of the Member States for the organisation and delivery of health services and medical care, that provision does not exclude that the Member States may be required under other Treaty provisions to make adjustments to their national systems of social security.</p>

 that it made no difference whether the Russo-German gas pipeline was routed over land or under water in order to be classified as a TEN-E project. The actual route, on the other hand, was considered to be a matter for decision by investors 'on the basis of their own commercial interests and judgements'.</p>
<p>Statements by the Russian Government concerning the Baltic indicate that selling energy to the rest of Europe also has purposes which go beyond purely commercial considerations. The EU should therefore pay attention to the concern felt by governments and by the public, for example in Poland, Finland, the Baltic States and Sweden. The authorities in southern Sweden, in particular, have expressed concern about the consequences for security policy in the Baltic in conjunction with even greater EU dependence on Russian energy. A trans-European project such as this ought, inter alia in the light of Russia's political development, to be based in equal measure on considerations of security policy, energy policy and environmental policy.</p>
<p>Does the Commission really consider it likely that Nord Stream will balance these interests?</p>

<p>A project on the scale of Nord Stream must necessarily take account of security issues as well as energy problems and, of course, environmental requirements.</p>
<p>This priority project, which has been declared to be of European interest, raises a question of security, as do all gas pipelines of such length. There is a degree of risk associated with both the construction and the operation of an industrial project ofthis scale, and it is incumbent on the operators involved to observe all the current regulations (national, European and international) and to take every step to reduce the risk as far as possible. Generally speaking, however, gas pipelines are the safest way of moving natural gas. The fact that Nord Stream is to be an underwater pipeline (that being the version of the project included in the guidelines for trans-European energy networks adopted by the Council and Parliament) is immaterial here: the dozens of ‘offshore’ pipelines that are currently in service in Europe, and have been for several decades, have proved their reliability in terms of security over all those years.</p>
<p>Energy considerations are also of great importance, particularly at a time when demand for gas is growing strongly and our own resources are shrinking. It is anticipated that by around 2015 the EU will be importing at least an additional 100 billion m<span class="sup">3</span>
 of natural gas each year. That is why, for more than a decade now, the Commission’s policy has been to promote the trans-European energy networks (TEN-E), and that is why it has just adopted a Plan for Priority Interconnections (PPI) involving some ten gas pipelines, including Nord Stream, that have been identified as strategically important for meeting the Union’s gas needs.</p>
<p>Full account must also be taken of environmental considerations, in compliance with the current legal requirements. In accordance with the UNECE<a href="#defann_28_2" name="refann_28_2"><sup>(2)</sup></a>
 Espoo Convention (signed by the nine Baltic states and the Russian Federation), the Nord Stream company is undertaking an environmental impact assessment, the final report on which is expected to appear before the end of 2007. This exercise has involved some 20 public meetings and around 100 meetings with the competent authorities in all the countries concerned. As the representative of the European Community – a contracting party to the Espoo Convention – the Commission was one of the parties notified in respect of three meetings, and it has already advised Nord Stream that it will be vigilant on observance of European and international environmental obligations.</p>

<p>What does the Commission understand by 'major problems with right-wing extremism'? Which political parties does this concern, according to the Commission? Does the Commission take the view that the parties in question should also be banned? If so, on the basis of what findings?</p>

<p>The Commission considers that it is important to maintain the memory of Nazi crimes as a tribute to its victims and as a means for educating future generations. Any attitude aiming at giving a positive or banal image of this ideology including the participation in the political life of parties claiming and defending it, is opposed to European Union values.</p>
<p>As regards extremism, the Commission reiterates that racism and xenophobia are incompatible with the principles upon which the European Union is founded and which are common to the Member States.</p>
<p>The establishment of an inventory of political parties on the basis of their ideology or their banning in the Member States does not fall as such within the powers conferred to the Commission by the EC Treaty.</p>
<p>An important step in the fight against racism and xenophobia is that the Justice and Home Affairs Council of Ministers, on 19 April 2007, reached a political agreement on a Framework Decision on Combating certain forms and expressions of Racism and Xenophobia by means of criminal law. The aim of this Framework Decision is to approximate criminal law provisions related to racist and xenophobic offences.</p>
<p>In the future, under certain circumstances, specific actions including actions of political parties could be considered under this new legislation.</p>

<p>In recent years, numerous studies have highlighted an alarming fall in the number of science and maths students, which is largely blamed on the way science is taught in schools. The report which the Commission asked Michel Rocard to draw up on a renewed pedagogy for the future of Europe recommends the adoption of more effective, enquiry-based teaching methods in schools and actively promoting on-going teacher-training in tandem with setting up intra-teacher networks. The report also says that 'specific attention should be given to raising the participation of girls in key schools science subjects and increasing their self-confidence in science.'</p>
<p>Given that only an improved scientific culture will enable a genuine knowledge society and knowledge economy to emerge in the EU, and that it appears that science education is the key to making progress in this direction, what steps does the Commission intend to take to promote the overhaul of science teaching in the Union's schools?</p>

<p>The Commission shares the concern of the Honourable Member at the relative decline of youngsters' interest in mathematics and science, especially of girls. This is happening while Europe faces a growing demand for qualified human resources in science and technology (S &amp; T) and skills shortages in those areas. It is all the more critical given the importance of mathematics, science and technology for European competitiveness and for the knowledge based society. Moreover, a good level of scientific culture plays a major role not only by enabling citizens to participate effectively in societal debates, but also to access better jobs.</p>
<p>For all these reasons, combating the declining interest and recruitment into science and technology studies and addressing the gender imbalance in this field is a priority objective of the Work Programme "Education &amp; Training 2010"<a href="#defann_33_1" name="refann_33_1"><sup>(1)</sup></a>
 which supports Member States in delivering their responsibilities for their education systems. It is also one of five European benchmarks for education and training agreed by the Council in 2003<a href="#defann_33_2" name="refann_33_2"><sup>(2)</sup></a>
. 'Mathematics, Science and Technology' is also among the eight key competences for lifelong learning, set out in a 2006 Recommendation from the Parliament and the Council<a href="#defann_33_3" name="refann_33_3"><sup>(3)</sup></a>
. The Commission's new Communication "Improving the Quality of Teacher Education" (adopted 3 August 2007)<a href="#defann_33_4" name="refann_33_4"><sup>(4)</sup></a>
 underlines the importance of teachers acquiring the full range of subject knowledge, attitudes and pedagogical skills needed to better prepare young people to take their place in society and in the world of work, namely by helping them to acquire the key competences identified in the Recommendation.</p>
<p>Within the Open Method of Coordination, the Commission has been working closely with Member States in this field since 2001. Two progress reports have been published, recommending that: “More effective and attractive teaching methods should be introduced, in particular by linking more systematically S&amp;T learning to real-life context and experiences”, and “teachers should be given opportunities to update their knowledge of both content and didactics”<a href="#defann_33_5" name="refann_33_5"><sup>(5)</sup></a>
. A mapping of relevant initiatives across Europe has also been carried out to encourage exchanges of experience and good practice<a href="#defann_33_6" name="refann_33_6"><sup>(6)</sup></a>
.</p>
<p>Eurydice, the information network on education in Europe, has carried out a survey on ‘Science Teaching in Schools in Europe’<a href="#defann_33_7" name="refann_33_7"><sup>(7)</sup></a>
 in 30 countries. The survey stresses the role of teachers in linking theory and practice and the importance of practical work in science learning. It also underlines the crucial role of gender awareness in teacher training.</p>
<p>The experts' report "Science Education NOW: A renewed pedagogy for the future of Europe" (group chaired by Mr Rocard), to which the Honourable Member refers, is a joint initiative of Commissioner responsible for Science and Research and Commissioner responsible for Education, Training, Culture and Youth. The report looks at existing European initiatives for more effective science teaching and calls for the introduction of a new approach to science education, mainly through inquiry-based teaching methods.</p>
<p>The Commission has started a debate under the current Presidency to identify together with the Member States possibilities to implement this report's recommendations.</p>
<p>The Commission will support initiatives of Member States and their efforts to modernize their education systems, namely on scientific teaching and learning. The instruments of the new Lifelong Learning Programme (LLP) offer a wide range of possibilities to this end.</p>
<p>The Commission also supports through its 7<span class="sup">th</span>
 Framework Programme for Research and Technological development actions aiming at enhancing formal and informal science teaching. In its Science in Society part, the 7<span class="sup">th</span>
 Framework Programme calls for the “creation of an open environment which triggers curiosity for science in children and young people, by reinforcing science education at all levels, including schools, and promoting interest and full participation in science among people from all backgrounds”.</p>

<p>A full and detailed assessment of the damages caused by the wildfires in southern Greece and the island of Evia in August 2007 has not been yet concluded by the Greek authorities. Fires have a direct damage effect in the stock of wealth (buildings, agricultural fields, livestock) that will slow growth. On the other hand the rebuilding efforts and the funds from public and private sources to be channelled to the regions hit by the fires, should positively impact investment activity over the coming years. Therefore the impact on economic growth of Greece is likely to be contained.</p>
<p>Regarding the possible application of Article 100(2), the Commission will examine the situation once a full and detailed assessment of the damages becomes available.</p>
<p>Other EU solidarity instruments are nevertheless envisaged. The President of the Commission and the Commissioner responsible for Regional policy stressed, in a visit to the affected areas, that when an assessment will have been made of the damage caused to the economy and to the environment, the Commission will activate the Solidarity Fund and whatever else is necessary to help Greece. In addition, the European Investment Bank has offered to put in place a framework loan rapidly in favour of Greece for an amount of €100 million, as a first instalment of a larger loan to be decided in view of Greece’s final requirements.</p>

<p>According to the Commission there are clear links between alcohol consumption and public health. As Commissioner Kyprianou stated in a speech to Parliament on 5 September, 100 000 people die of alcohol-related injuries or diseases in Europe every year. Alcohol costs EUR 125 billion per year and its social costs to the EU are therefore largely of the same order as those of tobacco. The reference level used in Sweden to determine whether alcohol transported across a border is for private or commercial use is currently 230 litres of alcoholic drinks per import consignment. Swedish policy on alcohol is made up of several components, one of which has been high excise duties and thus a high purchase price. However, the force of this tool has now been significantly weakened since the current EU rules permit the import of large quantities of alcohol from other Member States which do not apply the same policy. Does the Commission consider, in the light of the clear link between alcohol consumption and public health, that Sweden could adjust its reference level downwards on public health grounds without contravening EU legislation? Could Sweden, relying on Article 30 or any other section of the Treaty, set different import limits for alcohol as part of its restrictive alcohol policy?</p>

<p>The Commission shares the concern of the Honourable Member regarding alcohol misuse and that is why the Commission adopted on 24 October 2006 a Communication on reducing alcohol related harm. However, the vast majority of Member States do not consider it appropriate to curb alcohol consumption through the level of excise duties, inter alia because moderate, responsible consumption by adults is not considered detrimental to health or raises social concerns generally. Sweden follows a different policy in the matter. This forms part of the discretion left to Member States.</p>
<p>In accordance with the principle governing the internal market, Article 8 of Directive 92/12/EEC lays down that private individuals wishing to purchase alcohol in another Member State may do so provided the goods are transported by and are for the own use of the individual. The indicative level, totalling 230 litres of various categories of alcoholic drinks (among which only 10 litres of spirit drinks), to which the Honourable Member refers is laid down in Article 9 of that Directive. The purpose of guide levels fixed in accordance with this provision is only to provide orientation when it comes to establish whether the products are genuinely for the individual's own use and, therefore, not subject to duty in the Member State of destination, or whether they are for commercial purposes in which case duty will be due. Thus, the figures given in Article 9 shall not be considered as allowances. However, Member States may not fix guide levels lower than those set out in Article 9.</p>
<p>With regard to Article 30 of the Treaty, the Commission notes that Article 8 of Directive 92/12/EEC, read in connection with Article 9 thereof, exhaustively deals with the matter in question, namely importation of products from a given Member State into another Member State without payment of taxes in the latter. Indeed, these provisions take account of the interest, on the part of Member States, to apply their own taxes on products brought into their territory from other Member States. This interest may be related to tax income reasons or, indeed to other policy reasons linked to alcohol taxation, such as health protection. In this regard, it has to be recalled, first, that the harmonisation system to which these provisions belong does not foresee maximum rates, which implies that Member States may fix their national rates at any point equal or above the minimum rate, including for reasons of health protection. It has to be recalled, secondly, that in this very context, some Member States including Sweden have been granted transitional regimes.

<p>The Commission is alarmed by the outbreak of cholera in Iraqi Kurdistan and is following the situation closely. As reported by the World Health Organization, a high level committee chaired by the Minister of Health has been set up and necessary measures have been taken. The mortality rate has been reported as less than 1%, which suggests that the treatment of the patients is under control.</p>
<p>The World Health Organization is coordinating the response to the outbreak of the disease. As part of this response, the International Committee of the Red Cross, with the financial support of the Humanitarian Aid Directorate General (DG ECHO), donated necessary infusions to the local Ministry of Health authorities.</p>
<p>Furthermore, since 2004 the Commission has been systematically supporting the health sector in Iraq through the International Reconstruction Fund Facility for Iraq, United Nations Development Group - Iraq Trust Fund (UNDG - ITF), cluster D dedicated to Health and Nutrition. A new contribution amounting to € 12,000,000 was allocated to this cluster in June 2007 in order to prepare the national health authorities to deal with these and other threats of public health.</p>

<p>I should like to draw attention to the current situation in the Middle East and the Maghreb, which is making Christians feel increasingly unsafe. One of the reasons for this is the rise of Islamic radicalism. As a result, many Christians are emigrating. The Christian community that has been living in Iraq for centuries is in the worst situation, and its members are frequent victims of the terror spreading through the country. During the war in Lebanon, many Christians living in the country, who had nothing to do with Hezbollah, suffered. In Egypt, Christians have been caught in the middle of a conflict between the government and Islamic radicals. In August, two Christian activists belonging to the Middle East Christian Association were arrested and accused of voicing aggressive opinions about Islam. In Algeria, the government has restricted non-Muslims' freedom to profess their faith, and this has had a direct impact on Christians living in the country.</p>
<p>What steps has the Commission taken to enhance the safety of Christians in the region?</p>
<p>Does it intend to make representations to the heads of government of the countries in which persecution is going on?</p>
<p>Is it drawing up programmes under the Euro-Mediterranean Partnership aimed at improving the situation of Christian minorities in the region?</p>

<p>The Commission would like to thank the Honorable Member for his question regarding the situation of Christian minorities in the Middle East and the Maghreb.</p>
<p>The Commission is acutely aware of the reported constraints that Christians, but also other religious minorities are facing in many countries of the region. Together with the Member States it is paying very close attention to the human rights and democracy situation in the region, including as regards the respect for religious freedom and protection of religious minorities.</p>
<p>The EU is actively engaged in discussions on freedom of thought, conscience and religion with a broad range of countries in the region and raises these and other human rights concerns in political dialogue meetings with the countries concerned. It also voices its concerns regarding religious freedom and related intolerance and discrimination via demarches and public statements, reminding partner countries of their commitments under international law which prohibits discrimination on any grounds.</p>
<p>The EU is also actively seaking to advance the cause of human rights protection under the European Neighbourhood Policy (ENP). The jointly agreed ENP Action Plan with Egypt contains objectives to promote the protection of human rights in all its aspects; to improve dialogue between cultures and religions; to cooperate in the fight against intolerance, discrimination, racism and xenophobia and in the promotion of respect for religions and culture. Similarly, the ENP Action Plan with Lebanon attaches importance to the protection of rights of minorities as well as the fight against discrimination, racism, xenophobia and racial hatred discourse. Regrettably, there is no ENP action plan yet with Algeria.</p>
<p>As to the Commission assistance programmes, the Commission has extensively funded human rights and democracy projects addressing discrimination and minority issues under the EIDHR (European Instrument for Democracy and Human Rights), and will continue to do so in the future. In addition, the MEDA programme<a href="#defann_38_1" name="refann_38_1"><sup>(1)</sup></a>
 has given support to the establishment of national human rights strategies and national institutions on human rights.</p>

<p>The Commission is aware of the work recently published in the scientific journal 'The Lancet' which indicated that consumption of some food additives could have an influence on hyperactive behaviour in children.</p>
<p>The Commission has asked the European Food Safety Authority (EFSA), as the risk assessment body within Europe, to examine the findings of this study and any other related information in the public domain and to provide an opinion as soon as possible.</p>
<p>On the basis of the opinion of EFSA the Commission will consider if any further measures are necessary.</p>
<p>Before food additives are approved for use within the European Union they must first be evaluated for their safety. All food additives which are authorised within the European Union have therefore previously been evaluated by either the EFSA or the Scientific Committee on Food (SCF). Moreover the Commission keeps all additives under continuous observation and requests EFSA to examine any new findings which may change the outcome of a previous evaluation.</p>
<p>Additionally in relation to the proposal on food additives which is part of the Commission's package of proposals on food improvement agents, the Commission has asked the EFSA to undertake a re-evaluation of all currently permitted food additives. This re-evaluation is underway and EFSA are in the process of re-evaluating the permitted food colours.</p>

<p>With the last enlargement round, the number of deaths from suicide in the EU has come to about 60,000 per year. It is estimated that 10 times more people undertake suicide attempts.

Tackling suicidal behaviour should therefore be a public health priority.</p>
<p>The Commission is active. It co-finances the European Alliance Against Depression (EAAD) from its Public Health Programme. Depression is a major cause for suicide and many regional networks against depression has already been created across Europe.</p>

<p>Tens of thousands of people living in many cities and regions of Attica and Boeotia are using poisoned water because of the pollution of the groundwater and the springs which feed the above regions with hexavalent chromium, nitrates, chlorine and lead which have been found in the basin of the river Asopos. Greek governments since 1996 bear a heavy responsibility for this situation, because, despite warnings by the competent bodies about the steadily increasing pollution of the groundwater caused by the uncontrolled dumping of industrial waste, they failed to take any measures to protect public health.</p>
<p>Will the Commission say whether it intends to examine measures and fund actions to help protect public health and ensure that these regions are supplied with safe water, decontaminate the groundwater and protect it from industrial waste and conduct research into the public health consequences for inhabitants of these regions and the risk of the pollution spreading?</p>

 (WFD) requires Member States to carry out an analysis of the impacts of the human activities on the status of waters by 2004. To date, Greece has not carried out a proper environmental assessment as required by the WFD and consequently the Commission initiated an infringement procedure in relation to compliance with Articles 5(1) and 15(2) of the WFD, which has been brought before the Court on 21 March 2007.</p>
<p>The limited information provided by the Greek authorities in the context of WFD reporting acknowledges the presence of high concentrations of organic pollutants and nutrients (phosphorus and nitrates) in the river Asopos, due to industrial and waste water discharges and agricultural activities.</p>
<p>The Commission will further investigate this case and request additional information from the Greek authorities about the situation in the Asopos river basin, and in particular as regards the quality of the drinking water.</p>

<p>The question refers to an ongoing decision-making process at the International Standards Organisation (ISO) which is very controversial as a result of the strongly held positions of different stakeholders.</p>
<p>The Commission is aware that irregularities regarding decision-making at both national and international levels have been reported in the media. However, the Commission is not directly involved either in the process or in the governance of ISO, and is therefore not in a position to undertake a verification of alleged improper behaviour.</p>
<p>ISO is an independent international standards organisation. The responsibility for the proper functioning of ISO is primarily with its members, the national standards bodies, and it is for them to verify the reported irregularities and to consider a possible follow-up.</p>
<p>Generally, the corrrect functioning of international standardisation is important for the EU standardisation policy. Therefore the Commission encourages ISO and the other recognised standards bodies to respect the World Trade Organisation principles of international standardisation, namely transparency, openness, inclusiveness, impartiality and consensus, effectiveness, relevance and coherence.</p>
<p>The Commision expects ISO and its members to fully implement these principles in their decision-making processes. Through the agreement for cooperation between the European Standards Organisations and the Commission, European national standards bodies are also expected to respect the same principles.</p>
<p>The Commission is committed to ensuring competition based upon merit . In this regard, it is important that standard-setting processes are subject to open and transparent procedures, as outlined in paragraphs 159-178 of the Commission's Guidelines on the applicability of Article 81 of the EC Treaty to horizontal cooperation agreements<a href="#defann_43_1" name="refann_43_1"><sup>(1)</sup></a>

The directives in question above all introduced a number of well-functioning national bodies to deal with complaints, but this is often failing to lead to sanctions being imposed. In a number of countries, bodies for dealing with complaints about racism have not yet even been set up, although this is a requirement of Directive 2000/43/EC. Is the Commission aware of the report?

<p>The Commission is aware of the "Report on Racism and Xenophobia in the Member States of the EU" recently published by the Fundamental Rights Agency.</p>
<p>The Commission places great importance on the correct transposition of Directive 2000/43/EC, the "Race Equality" Directive, by the Member States. It has examined in detail the legislation of the Member States, and decided to send reasoned opinions to 14 Member States on 27 June 2007. As regards the "Equality Bodies" that the Member States are obliged to have under the Directive, only two Member States still have no such body to help victims of discrimination. The Commission has contacted the national authorities on this point.</p>
<p>The Commission is encouraged, in its contacts with the national authorities, by the increasing level of compliance of national law with the EU anti-discrimination Directives.</p>
<p>The Commission takes a number of actions to encourage Member States to fight against discrimination. For example, it funds a large number of initiatives which aim to prevent or reduce discrimination, such as awareness raising, fighting against stereotypes, training for NGOs, trade unions and the legal profession and the exchange of good practice between Equality Bodies. These are an essential complement to the EU legal framework.</p>

<p>Textiles and more specifically textile trade with China is a crucial item on the Commission's agenda for the end of 2007. In this context, the Commission has been consistently concerned and defended the interests of the European industry.</p>
<p>Indeed against a background of virtually free access to the EU market, the export oriented EU Textile and Clothing Industry is faced with high tariffs and non tariff barriers which hamper access to key markets and thus curtail the industry's possibility to enhance their competitiveness. The work achieved in the High Level Group (HLG) i.e. the Market Access Action Plan (MAAP) is extremely valuable. The Commission is pursuing the implementation of the MAAP in its bilateral encounters as well as at the multilateral level with a view to seeking better market access. Efforts will continue to focus on seeking the reduction or elimination of tariffs and/or Non-tariff Barriers (NTBs) in the context of bilateral negotiations or instruments, or through other World Trade Organisation instruments.</p>
<p>On the specific item of China Textiles, the Commission wishes to re-iterate that according to the EC-China Memorandum of Understanding signed in Shanghai in June 2005 the agreed import limitations on the ten textiles and clothing categories will be lifted on 31 December 2007. The Commission is fully aware of the importance of the textile sector in the EU industry and of the interests of certain Member States and regions in the sector. The Commission has, however, no intention to propose to extend the quotas on imports of certain textile and clothing categories beyond 2007.</p>
<p>The Memorandum of Understanding also covers the year 2008. In order to ensure a smooth transition in 2008, the Commission will closely monitor imports of textiles from China. To this end, the Commission is currently considering the introduction of a surveillance mechanism without any quantitative restrictions in the form of either single (on the EU side only) or double surveillance (on both the EU and Chinese sides) system. This is currently being discussed with all parties concerned.</p>
<p>The Commission will elaborate a formal proposal in due course with the aim of having a formal decision made public by the end of October 2007.</p>

<p>Even experts who have been dealing with the question of the EU agencies for years do not know the answer to some basic questions because of a lack of transparency. So:</p>
<p>Which Commission directorate-general is at present responsible for which decentralised agency?</p>
<p>How many members of staff in the relevant Commission directorates-general were responsible for the decentralised agencies, for each of the years from 2000 to 2006, and how many are responsible at present?</p>
<p>How great was the financial outlay, broken down into administrative, operational and staff activities, in the individual Commission directorates-general for these agencies in the period from 2000 to 2006?</p>

<p>The buy-back by the company J.P. Morgan of a Greek Government structured bond worth 280 million euros from the pension funds TEADY, TSEYP, TEAYFE and TEAPOKA, and the repayment by the company of accumulated interest during the second quarter and taxpayers' money for the first quarter, show how great a responsibility this American bank bears for the management of pension fund reserves. The fact that financial bodies admit to pillaging pension fund reserves shows the risk that such funds are exposed to, when they are placed in private hands and vulnerable to exploitation.</p>
<p>What does the Commission think of the procedure involving the buying and selling of structured bonds of the Greek State, which have ended up in their entirety in pension funds via manifestly illegal procedures? To what extent does it think the American bank is responsible and what can be done to ensure that pension fund reserves do not fall prey to the profit-seeking of monopolistic financial institutions, but are used instead for the benefit of workers?</p>

<p>The Commission has no general supervisory role on the functioning of the pension funds in the Member States. Since the information provided obviously concerns pension funds responsible for administration of statutory pension schemes (as opposed to occupational pension schemes), it does not indicate infringements of provisions of Community law such as for instance Directive 2003/41 on the activities and supervision of institutions for occupational retirement provision. Therefore, the case at issue does not fall within the competence of the Commission.</p>
